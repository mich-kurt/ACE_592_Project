"I started ozempic 9 months ago. At the time I was a little over 200 lbs and was taking 1000 mg of metformin daily. Metformin had worked for me for almost 20 yrs so I didn't expect that is had suddenly stopped working. For 3 years I gained weight even though I worked out, and I thought it was just my appetite out of control. One random day I realized my metformin was the problem. I saw a new dr who prescribed ozempic. What a miracle! 9 months later and I’m down 40 lbs, my a1c dropped from 8.1 to 5.6, and I have virtually no symptoms from the drug other than fullness. The symptoms in the beginning did not last long either. Nausea, headache, fatigue...all cleared up within a week or 2 each time my dose was increased. It can cause what feels like constipation but for me it’s just that I simply haven’t eaten enough. This drug feels too good to be true. I’m so pleased with my experience so far!",10.0,Ozempic
"I did one injection and have been ill since.
Have had acid reflux, burping, vomiting, constipation, headache and dizziness. I tried to eat small meals and drink plenty of water as directed by my physician, but I have been unable to hold anything down. 5 days after my first injection, I'm off work drinking pedialyte trying to get my strength back and avoid being hospitalized. This is the worst that I have ever felt in my life.",1.0,Ozempic
"I’ve been Ozempic for 4 weeks.  I am so glad that my doctor sat me down and told me what to expect.  She also asked if I could handle it.  She said that if you can make it through the 4th week I promise it will get better.   She was right.  I was pretty sick the first two weeks.  I learned that it had a lot to do with me trying to eat my normal intake of food.  Once I started to catch a clue and making my portions smaller, I learned it would make me feel better.  I could guarantee if I ate too much, I’d feel like crap.  People aren’t kidding about the side effects.   It’s real.  But I made it and am now starting to feel better with each day.  I’ve lost 18 pounds now and I’m amazed.   Yes it makes you sick but if you keep trying to eat like you did it will be worse.  You have to start listening to your body    You can’t keep eating your same amounts and expect to lose weight.",10.0,Ozempic
"Started on Ozempic Sept 2020, starting weight 312 lbs (5’ 4”).  I am type 2 diabetic and take 2550mg of Metformin daily. HbA1c was 79, sugar cravings and blood sugar out of control. Started on 0.25 dose, for a month. Quite bad stomach cramps and nausea for the first month. Went up to 0.5 on month 2, then 1.0 dose for month 3 and since. No 1 tip - inject into your leg rather than around your belly. Once I changed to injecting in my leg, nausea and cramps disappeared overnight & never came back. To maximise effectiveness, you can’t eat like you did before. I re-joined Weight Watchers in Sept. I have lost 80lbs in 5 months, HBA1c dropped from 79 to 51 which is normal type 2 level although the doc feels with more weight loss, it could go to normal levels. In Ireland, diabetes is classed as a long term illness so all medications are covered by the government so I don’t have to pay for this. Otherwise costs €195.",10.0,Ozempic
I took one Ozempic injection at .25 and ended up at ER 2 days later. I had horrible bloating. Burping smelled like eggs. Unstoppable vomiting and diarrhea. I ONLY TOOK ONE INJECTION and stopped the medicine. It has been 2 weeks and the medicine still making me sick. I'm just wondering how long it takes to fully leave your system? I just want to feel human again. I was tested for pancreatitis but was ok but dr said will repeat labs soon. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION TO ANYONE. PLEASE BE SAFE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.,1.0,Ozempic
"Ozempic has caused me so much constipation !!! I know a side effect is diarrhea but it does the complete OPPOSITE for me . A day or two after I take my injection I have no bowel movements at all !! Every week I  am forced to take a laxative . It has caused so many problems for me . 
Anyone else experienced severe constipation . So frustrated",1.0,Ozempic
"I'm a 54 year old female who's a1c was 8.3 at the end of March.  So after 4 months on Ozempic, my a1c is now 6.3! and I've lost 34 lbs. Definitely curbs my appetite and I have been logging my food.  My side effects have been minimal, a little nausea in the beginning and constipation. This med has been a game changer for me. My hope I that many others will have the same results I have.",10.0,Ozempic
"I was terrified to take this after reading some of the reviews online, but I have to say I am so happy I started this drug. I've followed others suggestions about injecting the drug into my upper thigh and not my abdomen. I was on a .25 dose for 4 weeks then moved to .5 and that's what I currently take. My appetite has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY. I was addicted to eating junk foods, and I simply cannot eat them anymore, my stomach cannot handle them. I get full after eating one proper sized meal, and it keeps me going for most of the day, only having a snack like 1 apple in the evening. Side effects were mild for me, had some constipation but I started taking fiber supplements to help with that. I have been on the medication for 7 weeks now and I'm down 10lbs and I feel great. Make sure your doctor gets you to increase the dose slowly, inject into your thigh and be ready to make 
better dietary choices when starting this drug. I truly believe it saved me from morbid obesity.",10.0,Ozempic
"After reading this, that junk in the fridge will go in the garbage. 
Do NOT  put yourselves through this for weight loss and even diabetes.
I mean seriously, which is worse?
Pancreatitis? Thyroid cancer? Horrible gastro conditions? 
Injecting ourselves with this lizard juice can't be good for us.
And, it’s beyond expensive to say the least.
Pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed of themselves but that’s nothing new. 
This is totally off the charts.
Just say no to drugs these drugs.

"I started Ozempic in late December at .25 injection. I also take 500mg metformin per day. Soon after I started Ozempic I had decreased apetitite and my sugars improved, but I had reflux, gas, bloating, nausea and diarrhea. After 4 weeks I started .50. 2 weeks in I have bouts of painful constipation then diarrhea, nausea, bloating, gas, reflux and cramping. I've almost vomited a few times. When I eat it feels like the food just sits and sits, barely moving through my gut. My doctor wants me to stick with it, saying that these side effects usually improve, but It's been pretty miserable. I'm thinking I'm going to stop taking it. While Ozempic has been effective in regulating my sugars and losing weight, I don't think it's worth the suffering that I've been enduring on this medication. I understand that studies showed it causing thyroid cancer in mice, but no one knows if it causes thyroid cancer in humans. I don't want to be the guinea pig the drug makers use to find out it does.",5.0,Ozempic
"Been on Ozempic since mid April 2020. All side effects listed with the worst being chronic diarrhea. Nausea has been significant, but has settled to occasionally.

"I was put on Ozempic after taking Gliperide for several years. I started on 0.25mg then on to 1mg. I started having the nastiest burps ever, then diarrhea 3 to 4 times a day. After 3 months I went to a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a side effect of Ozempic. I  have all the side effects nasty ,offensive smelling burps, eye floaters in both eyes, bad diarrhea, stomach pain, now this disease that has caused pre cancer cells. Yes, my appetite has decreased, I have lost 15 lbs in 3 months, my numbers are good. But not worth being sick every day. Just found out my daughter is going thru the same exact thing. So take it at your own risk.",,Ozempic
Did the first 4 weeks o Ozempic @ .25 had mild stomach issues. Nausea was come and go really not consistent. Helped control my eating. Dr said if you over eat or eat like you used to you will throw up. There is no place for the over eating but up. Didn't over eat didn't have much issue. Took stool softener to keep things moving. At the .5 dose ate less but less side effects than my first dose. Glad I have started the med it works.,10.0,Ozempic
"I have been taking Ozempic for 4 months to reduce insulin resistance (caused by polycystic ovary syndrome).  The medication has significantly reduced my appetite.  I have had a few minor side effects - a stomach cramp here, an episode of diarrhea there...but nothing at all significant.  My weight went from 151 (BMI 25.9) to 133 three months later (BMI 22.8).

Minimal side effects include occasional nausea and constipation. Started using miralax which has helped. Side effects I have experienced are worth the benefits. I consistently wake up with glucose levels in 80-90 range, never out of green zone on glucometer. I cannot over eat. If I do I feel ill or get heartburn so I have learned my lesson.

"I suffered from
-Loss of appetite 
-Exhaustion 
-Nausea 
-Vomiting (once a week usually 2 days after my injection)
-Low blood sugar events (probably caused because just had no appetite)

When I spoke to my pharmacist she encouraged me to try to hang in there telling me it would get better and it finally has. I was not expecting it to take over 3 months though.
My readings are all good and I've lost 28lbs so there were benefits to sticking it out but it was hard. I had decided that I would continue to take the medication until my next appointment and if things were still bad I would tell the Dr that I  no longer wanted to use it. Things are better and my appointment is next week.",5.0,Ozempic
"Honestly am so impressed so far with these meds. My weight had 
 been creeping up due to insulin resistance (which itself makes it harder to lose weight) and PCOS. My doctor recommended I try this in conjunction with a very low carb and calorie diet. I started with a half dose of 0.25mg once a week injection and then after 2 weeks up to 0.5mg a week and so far in 6 weeks I’ve lost 15cm from my waist and 9cm off my hips, 5cm off my bust. I have been eating lite and easy roughly 1000 calories a day. Haven’t weighed myself yet as I’d prefer to see the difference in cm. This medication makes me feel a little nauseous the first day or two after my shot but after that I never feel hungry. I can quite easily eat a super small portion and feel full! I drink about 2L of water a day and do about 8000 steps at my job. It really has been great and sooooo much cheaper than Saxenda which was another one I was considering. Hopefully I continue to lose weight!",10.0,Ozempic
"I've been on it for 7 weeks. I have had the runs as others have noted and the sour stomach, but what I also noted is that those symptoms are worse if you've eaten too much, or a heavier meal before bedtime.  Small snacks are ok.  

I don't drink any sugar laden beverages, and I eat lots of fiber already.  My diet is mostly vegetarian, but not for any reason other than my stomach just feels better on it.  I think that has helped keep the side effects in check.

So far I've lost 8 lbs, which TBH is kind of shocking.  I never thought my body would give up this weight, but I'm heading in the right direction.  Sugars are dropping nicely, especially my fasting sugar.  I have that hypo drop and spike when you wake up, and that seems to be levelling off, which is great.  So I'm going to keep going. Oh and I didn't jump in with dosing, I started with .25 and kept on that for six weeks and only just now moving to .5.  Slow gradual is the right way.  Too much at once will make you sick.",9.0,Ozempic
"Listen to me- Ozempic will change your life- but you CANNOT eat synthetic sugar AT ALL. I had severe hashimotos, PCOS, insulin resistance and severe diabetes symptoms. HBA1C was high, all cholesterols were high despite the healthiest of diets. My numbers cleared from severe to perfect in 1 month!! I had full body swelling, severely cracked ankles, swollen feet, neck, legs, major hair loss… a nightmare. I began taking Ozempic- I was very sick. It made me extremely nauseous- I got severe diarrhea, but let me tell you- I lost 17 pounds of water weight in ONE month. My dr couldn’t believe it. In four months, I lost 40 lbs. the nausea was mild to severe the entire time, but the results were borderline insane. It reset my metabolism, took ALL of the inflammation away from my joints, neck, back, my feet completely healed within one month. It’s barely believable. I spent two months on .25 and increased to .5 once a week for ten more months. High praise!!",10.0,Ozempic

Results: blood sugar in perfect range,  lost 20 pounds (15% body weight), loss of sense of taste for tons of foods, alcohol aversion. All in all I’m far healthier but I do miss enjoying food.

"I have been on Ozempic for 2.5 weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds. I don’t eat anything fried or greasy. I watch fat intake because this medicine can make you sick if you have too much fat in what you are eating. It can also make you sick if you overeat. If you eat small - moderate meals with light snacks in between, you will probably not have any problems. If you cannot stay away from fast food and greasy pizza, you will have a problem. I have found that this medicine makes me not as hungry. It takes the edge off. It also keeps me from craving junk. I get full at meal time, eating less. I drink a lot of water too. I also use an app on my phone to log food, calories and exercise. I weigh once a week. I hope this helps someone else that is considering this drug.",10.0,Ozempic

No side effects in the slightest. I also didn’t lose much either though because it is your body getting used to the medication rather than fixing your blood sugars.

I have started going to the gym.

Have been on Ozempic for 10 months. The first 3 months were very difficult with strong side effects. Mainly constant, but low level, nausea, occasional vomiting, and diarrhea (especially two days after the injection). However around month 3 the nausea and diarrhea subsided greatly and my appetite returned. I had lost weight very quickly (42lbs in 3 months due to not really eating much). Had to take supplements for a while but am now eating well. The rapid weight loss led to telogen effluvium, a temporary hair loss condition. (I shedded A LOT but never showed any baldness or anything).

Blood sugar control is excellent, and I suspect will only improve after the continued weight loss.

I’m back to wanting to eat again but have to control myself or face the terrible consequences. Blood sugars are all over the place as you can imagine however insulin sensitivity is way better. Just takes time to get used to, hope this helps",6.0,Ozempic
"This medicine did what it was supposed to. It lowered my A1C, but it also almost me off. I was so sick. I had to stop it. The worst medicine ever! I felt like I was reaching the end of my life. I couldn't do anything, couldn't eat, couldn't even get out of bed. I lost a lot of weight! My stomach hurt, my side hurt, my back hurt. I started feeling better once I quit taking it! I will never take it again! It almost felt like it was poisoning my entire body!",1.0,Ozempic
"Take my comments for what they are worth since I changed many things in my life at the same time...but..

I think Ozempic is great.  After 5 months reduced my A1c from 9.7 to 5.9.  Lost almost 25 pounds.  Am at .5mg and it has drastically reduced my appetite.  Between smaller stomach and this drug often push my plate away before finishing, rarely desire for dessert.  

Little to no side effects overall.  Some stomach issues like constipation, bloating but can’t rule out dietary changes being the cause also.  Went on a low carb diet and really stuck to it for once and increased exercise a lot.   Use of the Freestyle Libre Sensor really really helped too!  Being able to learn how things effect your blood sugar in real time is a great motivator to do the right thing, combine carbs with protein etc

Hoping to lower other meds I am on when I see my Doctor next month.  Once a week tiny needle (virtually pain free) is a far better system than pills everyday.",10.0,Ozempic
I have taken opzempic for a month now dosage being 0.25 once a week and at first I didn’t really see any side affects or anything but then boy one day I made the mistake and over ate and had gas constantly and kept burping repeatedly and then and hour later non stop diarrhea. After making that mistake I have taken into account never by any means do that again. I usually now just eat a big breakfast and like a snack later on throughout the day and it’s helped me completely cut out soda entirely. I originally started taking this because I was experiencing rapid weight gain and they checked my thyroid and said it was within normal limits so they put me on this and I am so glad. I wake up in the morning and I haven’t had a blood sugar reading over 130 in a month I can’t wait to go back to my doctor and figure out what my A1C is. But in total I’ve lost 8 pounds in one month :),10.0,Ozempic

"Started taking Ozempic for pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.  This is first medication I've ever taken for diabetes.  A1c was 5.7.  I increased dose quickly at doctor's recommendation if little to no side effects occurred.  First dose 0.25 in office.  Second 0.5 a week later.  Third dose at 1.0 a week after that.  Only side effect I have is mild nausea.  Appetite has disappeared and I eat only when hungry and much smaller portions.  Serious bloating when I eat too much, which is a great deterrent.  Been on medication 4 weeks overall, 2 weeks at 1.0, weigh dropped from 305 lbs. to 295 lbs.  Still a little lethargic but I was very lethargic before starting medication.  I feel like this medicine is a game changer for me.  I love not thinking about food all of the time, only eating when hungry and not for pleasure, and losing weight.  Will retest A1c in 2 months.  Hopefully the weight loss continues and I caught the A1c level before it turns into full-blown diabetes.",10.0,Ozempic
"I am male (early 50s). Blood glucose was already regulated with metformin, diet, and exercise (100 to 150), but I wanted to quit metformin because of its side effects (diarrhea). I was put on 0.50 mg/wk and warned that nausea from Ozempic was a common side effect. I HAD NO IDEA! WEEK 1/WEEK 2: I couldn't smell food without getting queasy. I choked down lots of soup just to get 1200 cal/day (often falling short). WEEK 3/WEEK 4 got slightly better. WEEK 5: I have my appetite back. I feel full, so I eat smaller meals. My weight loss is atypical: 203 lbs to 183 lbs in five weeks, combined with exercise (1 hr/4x wk stationary bike/treadmill). Blood glucose is now between 90 and 120, with occasional dips and peaks.

My only side affect has been an occasional headache but nausea was brutal. I was getting very nauseated after eating and taking Synjardy xr until I heard about ZOFRAN let me just say if you have nausea and are taking Metformin with Ozempic PLEASE ask your doctor for a prescription of ZOFRAN (I got the generic ONDANSETRON 4mg) I take it 20 minutes after I eat and have taken my metformin I NO LONGER get nausea. Zofran will definitely help with nausea if you're feeling sick. You'll thank me later.,10.0,Ozempic

I’ve just stopped taking my Metformin as they were dropping too much.  I didn’t even make it to the 1mg, stopping at the .5mg.  If you can last the first 4 weeks, it’s amazing.

My doctor wanted me to try Ozempic to help me lose weight and possibly eliminate the metformin. The side effects were terrible right from the start.  Nausea and diarrhea, no vomiting just nausea.  I started at .25 and am now up to 1.0. 

My appetite is gone completely.  I have no desire to eat at all.  When I  do eat,  I get full almost immediately.  I have gone from 228lb down to 202lb in the six weeks I have been taking ozempic. I'm thrilled with the weight lose, and the nausea and diarrhea have improved.

However, I have almost stopped peeing.  I go in the morning, then go all day into the evening without going.  Since I suffer from incontinence, it's good, but I am worried that it might be damaging my kidneys.

I do get burps after eating and occasional stomach pain that is tolerable.  Perhaps it’s the combination of all bringing down my levels that gives me two things I didn’t expect, clear clarity in thinking (better memory recall) and a lot more energy (as in stable for a good 10 hours and then I start getting fatigued).

The first .25 dose caused significant nausea but I battled through it for a couple weeks before starting the .50 dose. The nausea increased with the higher dose and I considered stopping but had lost ten pounds and had zero appetite and my sugar was down so chose to continue.

My target BMI weight for 6 foot 3 is 210 but I would be happy at 225.

Not a real pleasant experience so far, but I have not vomited or had diarrhea as some  users have reported.  It does appear to be lowering my blood glucose somewhat,  which is the primary reason I am taking it.  I am also taking metformin but have been able to reduce the dosage.

"I was moved to Ozempic from Januvia. At the time I started Ozempic, I'd brought my blood sugar down to what would translate to an A1C of 5.5 or so, and I'd managed to kick most of the insulin I was on. I started Ozempic at 0.25 units per week and had mild nausea and diarrhea, but my appetite vanished and I could barely bring myself to eat. Once I started the full dose, my blood sugars began to climb rapidly. I'd be fine in the mornings at first and then experience wild spikes between meals, until finally my fasting sugar started to climb out of my desired range. I actually had to take MORE insulin, not less, just to keep my fasting BG below 7.

"I started with 0.25 Ozempic in November 2020 and upped my dosage to 0.5 in January 2021.
My a1c is the same as when I was taking 2000mg Metformin daily (5.1-5.3%). My Dr decided to switch me to help with weight loss and manage my pre-diabetes. 
I have lost 47lbs, which is great but it isn't a healthy way to lose weight. I met with a GI specialist and was diagnosed with Gastroparesis, they had me discontinue Ozempic to see if my symptoms would disappear. That was 6 weeks ago and my stomach is still paralyzed. I have sulphur burps, diarrhoea, severe constipation and vomiting daily. I now have to eat a low FODMAP diet and can only manage a few mouthfuls of food at a time. I have no quality of life anymore, I can no longer enjoy many of the things I used to which has caused me severe anxiety and depression.

"Freedom! Freedom from the constant food/sugar cravings that ruled my days. I’m starting week 2 and have felt a bit of Sour stomach but to be honest, less uncomfortable than overeating or indulging in   Fast food/sugary foods that we stuff ourselves with. The most I felt was after eating ice cream. Well, of course! This truly regulates numbers and totally takes away appetite. My meals are very small, clean, nutrient dense taken to refuel my body, rather than to seek pleasure/soothe (insert and bad feeling). Go figure - kind of how we are designed to eat? The best thing?

2nd week.  No negative side effects!  Has been life changing. I used to be dictated by severe hunger pains every 3 hours.

I have taken Trulicity for a number of years, it is in the same family of medications and if I could share one thing is that with these medications, for the first 2-3 days after you do your injection if you have a fatty diet at all in that time you get the nausea etc. If you stay away from fats in that time frame it seems to keep that at bay.",,Ozempic

I have lost 6lbs so far I was astounded it came off in the first week. 
The only time I have had bad stomach pains is when I've eaten something bad and I get terrible runs 20 mins after eating, but once I've been to loo pain stops.
I had vomiting once because I think I over ate a few days after taking it.  I was super bloated and a few hours later I threw up then I felt fine again. So I just eat little and often, mostly grazing and picking at fruit.
I was worried about taking this because of the comments I've read and with having IBS I didn't know if it would be bad for me. 
But I have no issues taking it and so far so good. Its still early days for me but I would 100% recommend it.",10.0,Ozempic

Januvia reduces A/1c by .8 percent or less than 1 percent. What does that actually mean? If you have an A/1C of 7.5 before Januvia, expect 7.44 after taking Januvia. Not impressive at all considering the cost and minor side effects.",1.0,Sitagliptin

"I am a Type-2 diabetic. I have been on Mounjaro for several months. It is controlling my blood sugar great, and I have lost some weight. My biggest problem with the Mounjaro is the fact that I cannot get it because of unavailability. I don't understand how people who want to lose weight take priority over people with a medical condition. The people with diabetes need this medication and are not able to get their prescriptions filled because the people who want to lose weight are hoarding this medication. I also want to lose weight, however, the control of my blood sugars is a priority to me. I cannot control my blood sugars without my medication.

Be careful when deciding to take this medication. I advise you to speak first with your doctor and if you could find another way to lose weight you should decide to go with something else. The side effects for some people are almost unbearable. I was 100% healthy before taking this. Now my blood sugar levels are low I can not wait for this to leave my system. It’s hard to work out I feel awful. Ever since I stopped taking it since my sugar levels are low I have to eat more sugar and it’s hard to eat. I feel nauseous and it’s so hard to start the day feeling like this. Please beware I know of people that are not even eating while taking this because they lost their appetite and they have to blend their food because it won’t go down.

I began my journey 08/23/22. As of 01/17/23 I am down 55lbs. I have had no issues. I truly have little to no desire to eat. I have to force myself to eat. My blood sugar is now normal to the low end. I really hope that insurance will kick in before the coupon is no longer effective. I am stunned by how well this has worked. I have tried other meds and nothing has come close. I am 11 lbs from my goal weight. I think I and going to have to readjust my goal. Yay!,10.0,Mounjaro
"Started at the 2.5 level and lost some weight.  (15 lbs.)  Sugars are down as well.  Greasy foods are not recommended.  Went to the 5.0 level and everything dairy went bad...sours on the stomach badly, and quickly.  Ate too much one night and got very ill, vomiting and diarrhea all night along with serious gas from both ends!  I don't like  that I can't have my diary, even tried Lactaid to no avail.

"I have been on Mounjaro since March 2023, it is now February 2024. When my doctor suggested Mounjaro to me, I was at a point in my life where I didn't think it could get much worse. My A1C was off the charts, I was severely obese at 280 pounds, and I was scheduling my 6th surgery in 7 months! Now, almost a year later, my diabetes is gone! I am 100 pounds down to 180 and no more surgeries in my foreseeable future! Game changer!",10.0,Mounjaro
I started out of the 5mg and was deathly ill from it for about a week with severe diarrhea and  belching that was so awful it made me want to vomit.  I lost 9 pounds and my sugars are going down and staying where they are supposed to be.  I called my doctor and she switched me down to the 2.5mg better just one day of illness.  Started back on the 5mg and I still feel horrible for 24 hours after day 2 of the shot.  But sugars are awesome and I'm hoping this too will pass,9.0,Mounjaro
"Mounjaro has been a life changer for me. I currently take 12.5 mg and have been on it for about two years. I have lost 141 lbs and I now weigh 115 lbs, size 22 to size 0-2. I was able to get off all other diabetes medications. I have severe insomnia on the night I take my shot whether I take it at night or in the morning. I take my shot in my thigh because my side effects are less when I inject it there. I steer away from carbs and sugar to avoid causing stomach issues. I do get tired the first few days after my shot but it could be because I don’t sleep well the night I take my injection.",10.0,Mounjaro
"Horrible experience taking this drug. I do not recommend taking this medication unless you want to die. I started taking 2.5 mg 6 days ago. Day 2 and 3 had no appetite and ate very little because the thought of food made me sick.Day 4 and 5 developed nausea, severe abdominal pain and indigestion unrelieved by antacids.I also have lost five 1bs because I am unable to eat or drink  anything. I do not have any energy or feel like doing anything. Day 6 and I still feel sick. My fasting Blood sugar this morning was 224 even though I  am not eating or drinking hardly anything at all. It is noon and I haven’t eaten anything because I’m afraid I will throw up. My heart rate is 120 and normally runs in the eighties. My doctor is out of the office this week for holidays.

I agreed to try 2.5, that was a horrible decision! My heart rate elevated, pulse, blood pressure increased, couldn’t eat, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of sense of balance. When to doctor 2 days later & I was so dehydrated I required 2 1/2 bags of IV solution to help me drive home. I can’t remember ever being so sick.

I am always full and started pushing myself to eat as I can go all day with nothing. Now I have small welts and itching at injection sites. Total weight loss “0”.  My blood sugar is higher especially in the morning. This drug is horrible and I won’t put my body through it anymore. I can lose weight easier and healthier than this since it ruined my Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. I was so excited to try it and have hope.

"I started Mounjaro 7 weeks ago. The first shot made me so nauseous and have such bad abdominal pain that lasted for 12 hours I almost went to the ER. Told my doctor about my experience and she gave me zofran and told me to continue dieting. Fast forward to this weekend- took my shot on Friday morning then spent all day Saturday and Sunday projectile vomiting (it literally ended up about 7 feet from where I was standing), uncontrollable diarrhea, disgusting sulfur burps, horrible heartburn, and dizziness. Finally decided to go to the ER and got treated for dehydration. They told me to follow up with my primary doctor to talk about the best way to continue the medication. After this experience I am NEVER taking this drug again. While I've lose 25lbs in the past 7 weeks I believe its mostly because I've been afraid to eat anything. I will continue to eat healthy and cut carbs and sugars but I won't be taking Mounjaro again.",1.0,Mounjaro

From about 5mg on I had to make myself eat and like others I started eating right. My energy levels are up. No vomiting or liver failure, thank God. I'm now currently on the 12.5mg.

"I started using Mounjaro at 2.4 mg, worked great, no side effects. After the doctor increased it to 5 mg, I developed severe stomach pain, both upper and lower. I couldn't tolerate the pain. I was taking oxycodone. Tried to live with the pain, but I couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped. Taking this medication, be very careful with what you're doing. My blood pressure was very high. My doctor was out of reach, so I went to another doctor. He prescribed a test on my pancreas, and the test came out bad. I was informed to stop this medication and take another test in six months. They didn't tell me what's wrong; they just told me to stop this medication and that I have to take another test in 6 months. It's very serious.",1.0,Mounjaro
"I had previously been on Trulicity, and the doctor switched me to Mounjaro since I have so much extra weight on me.  He started me on the 5mg pen since I had already been on Trulicity.  I lost minimal weight on Trulicity.  Some, but not enough to say it's awesome.  The only side effect I've had on Mounjaro is occasional constipation/reflux, which is manageable. Maybe it is because I got past/thru all the nasty side effects while on Trulicity, and that minimized the effects of Mounjaro?  I feel bad for all those that have had adverse effects on Moujarno.  I have lost about 10 pounds so far in just over 2 weeks, and I can tell a HUGE difference in my appetite. I mean HUGE.  I'm not hungry like I used to be.  In fact, this drug curbs my appetite SO much, that I have to force myself eat sometimes, and in having to do that, it makes me instinctively want to eat more healthy food. This drug has helped with weight loss, and I am excited to see how much I will lose and get my A1C down.",10.0,Mounjaro
Been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks for weight loss. Started with 2.5 the first month now on 5 mg. Lost 20 lbs so far.  Been on 5 mg for 5 days now and extremely fatigued and weak however I’m not going to complain because I’m not hungry at all. Have no desire for food since being on 5 mg.  You have to make yourself eat and drink because you feel full constantly. Mouth is very dry so drinking water regularly is a must. Highly recommend for weight loss. Hopefully the fatigue will go away once I’m into the second week of the 5 mg and my body adjusts.,10.0,Mounjaro
"In November 2022, my ACI was 7.4% and I weighed 258 pounds at 67 years old. The wake-up call was when I renewed my life insurance, big jump in premium due to the AC1 and weight. I was now tagged as a Type 2 Diabetic. I was referred to an Endocrinologist who did extensive blood work. It was agreed to go on Mounjaro 2.5 mg. The first week I suffered some side effects such as nausea,  constipation, and acid burps. Within 10 days, the symptoms subsided due to stool softeners, lots of fruit (berries), and Nexium. The first month I dropped 10 pounds with no dieting, just was not hungry at all. I had no cravings especially for sweets like cookies, donuts, and candy-all things that i used to eat. Fast forward March 2023, I am down to 217 pounds and 20 more to go. I am now on Mounjaro 10mg, it a bit strong, but the results are fantastic. My AC1 is now 5.6% which is fantastic.

"I had a very bad experience with Mounjaro.  After two weeks of taking the 5.0 mg, I developed chest pains and a severe case of what I thought was reflux or heartburn. I really felt like I might be having a heart attack. I stopped taking it and reported it to my doctor.  My doctor suggested I should continue taking it, but she would reduce the dose.  I went back on metformin for about a month; then, I started the 2.5 mg dose of Mounjaro.  I took the reduced dose for about two weeks and started having severe pains in my upper stomach.  I went to urgent care, and they examined me and took xrays, then sent me to the ER for further tests. After a CT scan, I was told my gallbladder was inflamed and needed to be taken out.  I was in surgery by 10:30 am the next morning to have my gallbladder removed.  I am 60 years old and have never had any problems this severe. I have fully recovered from the surgery but now have a $1700 hospital bill. Thank God for insurance. The total bill was over $50,000.",1.0,Mounjaro
"I have been on Ozempic 2mg since it came out. When I couldn't get it due to shortage I was prescribed Mounjaro 5mg. Five days after eating my one meal a day, I intermittent fast, and I started vomiting. I spent the whole night throwing up every half hour. I  figured it was a side effect and hoped I would improve. I had stomach and back pain, weakness, and was unable to eat. I was in bed until I had to get up and sit due to pain, sleeping off and on. I could only drink water. I got worse and finally, 5 days later had my husband drive me to the ER. I know I should have gone sooner. I didn't take a second shot.
I had a CAT scan and was told I had a bowel obstruction and I would be admitted and there for a few days. If they couldn't resolve through a tube down my nose I would have surgery. Luckily it was resolved by the nasal tube, but it was awful.

"Went to the doctor and asked for something to help lose weight. He prescribed this medication. Day 1 and 2... nothing. Day 3 woke up with horrible heartburn and sour sulfur burps and facts and was constipated. By day 3 evening I no longer had constipation but just the opposite...diarrhea! And not just any kind it was like yellow water and very acidic. It hurt! Had horrible gas and belching all day Saturday and Sunday couldn't hardly leave the bathroom to go buy immodium. Immodium helped with that but the gas is now trapped and my stomach hurts badly and I am full of gas with bad heartburn and belching. I saw a correlation between fatty foods and severe side effects of this product. But unless you're a vegan, you eat fat and that's a major problem with this product.

"I started on a 2.5 mg dose for 30 days and had nothing positive or negative. The doctor increased it to 12.5 mg and my appetite went to zero, stomach pain, throw-up, diarrhea generally nausea, and ill feeling, but did lose 15 lbs in 3 weeks and my blood labs were near perfect. I was ready to quit until I saw this. The second month my appetite came back slightly and I learned to eat less and cleaner so it wouldn’t make me throw up, lost another 15 lbs and it excited me to get back in the gym daily. Since the drug slows your digestion it slows the bowel too which gave me insane constipation and make sure I eat enough fiber daily. At first, the side effects are hell but stick with it as they only lasted a month, then your body adjusts and you learn how to eat and work with it. The end results are worth it. Its been 9 months and I have lost 35 lbs, labs are excellent and for the first time, I have seen glucose under 100 in 30 years.",10.0,Mounjaro
"I am overweight and was sent to an endocrinologist by my PCP.  A1C came back 6.9 and I received the dreaded diabetes diagnosis. Endocrinologist asked me about my eating habits and suggested Mounjaro once a week injection. Sceptical I was, but I was willing to try with getting my weight down and get my A1C down.  First injection, no severe vomiting or anything. The only side effect I had was the constipation, I was put on a stool softener and take fibre daily which eliminated that side effect.  Within two months I was down 15 pounds, have not given in to eating a Boston crème doughnuts on which I tend to binge, limited on my intake of food because over indulging makes me feel lousy and gives me indigestion, within three months my A1C is down to 5.3 and my weight is still going down.

"I responded very well going from 0.5 to 15 over time. My A1C is now down to normal and my morning fasting blood sugar (which is why I started this medication) is also normal. I have lost approximately 34% of original body weight over 13 months. I did have some gastric side effects intermittently but was able to manage them with no harm. We will taper off as this year progresses although the medication backorder may interfere with that process as we are looking to do it safely to preserve the diabetes progress I’ve made thus far. We shall see, but it seems strange that this medication continues to be advertised while there is a shortage. It also seems strange that in this day and age there is a shortage.

If you eat a lot of cruciferous veggies, you are going to be extremely gassy. If you eat too much or eat things that are hard to digest, it is going to be harder to tolerate this medication. I have not been under 200 lbs in 20+ years, so this has been a blessing. My blood sugars are in check, and I have more energy.

My doctor took me off of Mounjaro recently. I developed large welts about 24 hours after I injected the 75 doses and 10. 

My doctor fears I am developing an allergic reaction, so I am going back to the rival insulin alternative.

It should be noted that I really like the Mounjaro very much. Well-controlled sugar, once I was on my maintenance dose of 10. 

For some reason, I gained five pounds while on Mounjaro, I never lost weight. Where I lost about 15 pounds on the other mentioned insulin alternative.

I also started to notice a thickness or knot in my throat after the first 2 months. I had to stop taking because no amount of weight loss is worse than being a cancer patient or bed bound. The weight loss was extremely slow for me too. I went from being on no meds to relying daily on heartburn medicine, miralax, Tylenol & ginger chews for nausea. And the price was ridiculous. I would have rather bought some cosmetic surgery. I was on it 5 months. 2.5, then 0.5, finally 7.5mg.",2.0,Mounjaro

Was using it for my diabetes and the price went up on Medicare. Mounjaro changed my life for the better. Now cannot take it because of the cost. PROFIT is all that matters to you. Cost of producing it is not even close to the price you want to sell it to the public. Give us a break!!,10.0,Mounjaro

"I'm only on my second week, but I've lost 7 pounds so far. It forces me to eat because if I don't, I feel sick, but when I eat, I get full super fast... So it's like it's forcing me to do good and not starve myself. I really like that. The first week I had slight nausea here and there and a couple of headaches. Also a little indigestion. I do feel pretty tired. I've been eating a low carb diet. I'm going to incorporate exercise at the end of this week. I can only imagine how much I have the potential to lose once I start exercising, if I've lost 7 just by eating better. Over all I am satisfied with this drug. I'm on the low dose right now.",9.0,Mounjaro
"No side effects. Started 12 weeks ago. No problems. I have been on a very strict diet for 16 weeks. Now on the medicine Mounjaro. I am not hungry, so it's pretty helpful for my diet.

I don't want to lose muscle mass and I need to keep my strength and skin healthy and tight. I'm 62 years young. I have type two diabetes I got afterwards from Covid, as many have. I'm hoping the Mounjaro continues to work on my A1C. It looks like it has been so far. I will not be staying on this drug, I promised myself 8 months max, so pray for me and send good karma.

Can be an issue at times that only for myself, but other people I know on the same drug.  My PA is working very closely with her and paying attention to absolutely everything closely. I feel that it’s a safe drug so far if you have a doctor or PA that is on board with you and to a full degree of attention.

"I am taking or was taking Mounjaro and I have taken 2 months' worth of medication, and I was feeling great. Had to have a colonoscopy because of my age, not the medication, so was told to skip a week before. I did take my last shot. It has been 3 weeks, and I can't get the 5ml or the 7.5 ml. It has been over 4 weeks I have been waiting. I had to have my doctor make another refill, and I am still waiting. I have been a full-blown diabetic for about a year. I have been borderline for over 40 years. I have high blood pressure and cholesterol problems and feel that Mounjaro was helping, but the on-again, off-again is not helping, and I can't understand the shortage for medically needed purposes when I am over 300 lbs and 5 feet 6 inches. I have tried numerous weight loss programs and pills, but Mounjaro is helping me when I can get it. The biggest benefit is the calming effect my mind has over the worry about food or sugar levels or high blood pressure. I see a difference with Mounjaro.",9.0,Mounjaro

I keep pegging 70 because I can't eat and am sick to my stomach all the time. My sleep is interrupted, and I must lie down constantly. I feel like I want to sleep all the time.

"Happy Holidays Everyone, this medication is making it impossible for me to do anything. Dr prescribed it - Day 1 felt fine, Day 2 near the end of the day had no desire for food - nothing. Today is Day 3 and I’ve been nauseous all day and near the end of the day started to get diarrhea. The nausea has been pretty bad though I did work out (it made it worse and had to skip some of it). Also, today because of nausea, I have not wanted anything to eat. I forced myself to have half of an English muffin with peanut butter and then this evening a Campbell's soup to go since I was feeling so sick. I will not be taking the second dose this coming week when it is due because I feel miserable. It has a 5-day half-life which is why I didn’t want to take it to begin with in case of side effects. It seems a lot of people get these side effects and what I’ve learned is I always seem to get the side effects of medication. Be cautious. It needs a reversal pronto!",3.0,Mounjaro

The bad part is I was so sick on days 3-5 that it was awful. I couldn’t do my usual activities.  No swimming for fear of losing control of bowels, and severe nausea. It worked great but the side effects were extremely uncomfortable, lost sleep from GERD.  Disappointing for me.",1.0,Mounjaro

"I did have many side effects to this medication at first. However, more recently, I have been experiencing fewer side effects. My A1C before taking Mounjaro was above a 10, and now my A1C is 6.3. I have lost 40 lbs and have a satisfied feeling after eating a small amount of food. My side effects at the beginning were rough: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, stomach pain (by my liver and pancreas), excess gas/bloating, hypoglycemia, and sour stomach. I know that this is a bit of a list, however, I feel that it is worth it in the end. I work in a hospital and have seen the outcome of having long-term effects of diabetes; it is not pretty. So, if I have to suffer a little bit to try and prevent long-term effects, then I will. The main effects that I have now, after about a year or more of treatment, are diarrhea, sour stomach, and some gas/bloating.

Also, I have lost about 12 pounds in that time, which is fine, but I really don't need to lose more. I have reduced my long-acting insulin to about 1/3 of my previous dosage. What is amazing to me is that I can eat a meal and without fast-acting insulin, my blood sugars go down! I guess the Mounjaro somehow senses that blood sugar is starting to rise and signals the pancreas to secrete more insulin. So far, I'm more than happy with Mounjaro.",10.0,Mounjaro

I did not have the severe side effects that some have experienced. I felt a little nauseous, and quickly learned that I had to cut back on my food intake overall, plus eat less foods that are hard for my body to digest. I still get some uncomfortable feeling and tiredness about 2 days after the shot. My A1c and liver enzymes were finally heading in a downtrend at my Dr. appointment last month...the first in over 5 years. I have lost approximately 21 lbs.

Also, I need to take it just before I go to sleep or I will wake up with a bad stomach the next day. It is very good at bringing my blood glucose down and keeping it from getting too low.

"A little bit of back story for the full benefit of transparency…I am a type 2 diabetic on an insulin pump taking 2 Synjardy every morning in addition to my once-a-week injection. I was completely insulin resistant. Since starting the mounjaro in September 2022 on the lowest dose, I have worked my way up to 10mg. Now supply shortage kept me from getting my one-month supply twice in the last 7 months. When starting again it did give me nausea and headaches, my doctor prescribed Zofran and I took ibuprofen. When I started I weighed 330 pounds and am currently down to 289 as of yesterday. The biggest benefit to me is that my pump has had to work less because the mounjaro keeps my blood sugar steady at about 90. I am hoping as I continue to lose weight I need less and less insulin, that is the doctor's goal.

Now on Mounjaro and praying you keep your word and make certain that us diabetics can get it. My numbers are looking good again.  An eye Dr visit yesterday scared me because he said I have retinal bleeds that occur when blood sugars are too high.  Diabetics need this medication and while I understand weight loss is important losing my eyesight because my blood sugars are out of control is vital.

When I first started on the medicine, I could only eat a few bites of food and then would feel extremely full and bloated and would have to stop. Now, It is 4 full months later and I am on the 14mg and I can continue to eat beyond a few bites without feeling miserable, but I try to stop as soon as I am full.  I have, so far, lost 30 lbs with no exercise and have gone from a size 12/14 to a size 6/8.  Diabetes does run in my family, so I am hoping continued use of this drug may help prevent the development of diabetes in the future.",10.0,Rybelsus
"It’s been a week on Rybelsus 3mg.  I feel pretty good (except for seasonal allergies).  No nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, smaller appetite.  I am prediabetic with BMI >30.  I would like to lose 30 to 40 pounds.  I think Rybelsus will help me.  (Prior to taking Rybelsus, I was fasting (16hour/8hour) and exercising EVERY day and STILL gaining weight.) I think Rybelsus will help.  I weigh daily, and I am beginning to see the numbers ever so slightly trend down.  I am optimistic.  I will start 7mg after 30 days.  I hope to come back here and share my journey with you.",10.0,Rybelsus
"For 2 years my diabetes went out of control, to the point that I started having some mental issues, like brain fog. My Doctor put me on 3mg Rybelsus. The first two weeks it was a bit of a struggle.  Nothing I couldn't handle. Just nausea and no desire to eat. A month in my Doctor took me up to 7mg. The first week at 7mg. Same nausea but after the week ended.  It was gone. I still don't have a major appetite. Which is excellent. My blood sugar is 104 at this moment. I've lost so far 24 pounds so far in 6 weeks.  I love this stuff.  I also feel much better and I can actually think with out the fog. I recommend it",8.0,Rybelsus
I’ve been on rybelsus since 1 December at a dose of  3 mg. January 1 started 7mg. I don’t like taking medication and was scared of this medication due to other reviews I have read. I am very pleased with the outcome. I lost 5 lbs with very little exercise. My side effects were nausea and lost of appetite. Nausea only occurred when I ate junk food and sweets. A1c down from 7 > 6.2. Plus I do not take any other meds for diabetes. Hope my review will help others.  February 28.,10.0,Rybelsus
"I have been taking rybelsus for 6 months.  At first I was nauseous and had bad sulfur burps.  But, it went away.  My a1c is the best it's been in 9 years.  I have had a hard go at treating my diabetes, as most other oral medications and daily infections,  just made life harder.  

Now, my numbers are 6.7 and I have lost a significant amount of weight.  335lb to 285lb, with minimal effort. It definitely suppresses my appetite.   I've read you can only lose a few pounds, but, I feel like a lucky one.",10.0,Rybelsus
"I took 3 mg of Rybelsus for about two weeks. I noticed right away that I was not able to poop normally. I thought constipation would resolve naturally since I don’t have issues with it normally. Now, I’ve been off of it for a week and I’ve had two ER visits because I can’t poop. I also struggle to pee because the thought is the backed-up poop is pressing on things it shouldn’t. Had to have a catheter drain me out. I did a week of Miralax, two days of Dulcolax, one ER cocktail, and an enema, and none of it has helped. At this point, I’m scared it will take surgery to remove the poop. If you’re taking this medicine please stay in tune with your body and mitigate early if you’re starting to experience any constipation.",1.0,Rybelsus
"I first took the 3mg dose for 30 days, I had no side effects and it is really controlling  my appetite.

"My Dr put me on Rybelsus in March/April 2020. I will admit the nausea was pretty bad for about the first month but I stuck to it because it was really working well on my blood sugar. Since I started I have lost 42 lbs!!  I have not been dieting but I do have some outdoor projects that required physical labor, like shoveling dirt, clearing brush, moving stones, etc. The nausea only comes back when my sugar is low and I really need to eat. I don’t even get a growling stomach anymore. I would recommend Rybelsus to anyone looking to manage your blood sugar and lose some weight.",10.0,Rybelsus
I was very frightened after reading the reviews. I am 52 and had gained from 130  pounds to 158 the most I have every weighed in my life. Stated the 3mg 3 weeks ago and have lost 10 pounds and no side effects other than occasional slight nausea. My appetite has decreased but for the better. I am walking 3 miles a day and eating very healthy. Stopped drinking soda now only flavored water. I consider this a miracle. Never lost weight this quickly. Happy as heck. Will continue the 3 mg and recheck A1C. So far this rocks. If it enables me to get in control of my eating and lose to a healthy weight to better my overall health then I call it a huge success.

Dr. ordered 3mg 30 days ago to be added to Metformin 2000mg.   Blood sugars have decreased to from 200-350 range to 120-150 range.  Weight reduced by 14#.  I experienced nausea and fullness for first two weeks.  That has tapered off yet the appetite suppression has continued.  After a month Dr. is pleased with the results as am I.

"Dr put me on Rybelsus since I had bad luck with trulicity and feeling sick every time I took the shot. The first month of the dose 3mg I noticed I never ate, I had a complete lack of appetite. I was exhausted, weird dreams and a constant feeling of anxiety. Sometime insomnia. I put up with it. Second round with the 7 mg. The first day I was sicker than heck. I felt like I was on a cliff dangling, my anxiety turned into panic rapid heartbeat and unable to sleep. I stopped after day 4. Called dr left a message and she never got back to me. I am debating trying to take a 7mg every other day maybe or go back to the 3mgs and see if there is a difference now that it is almost out of my system. It is brutal to the body.

I started Rybelsus (paying out of pocket-Ouch) to see if it’s worth hassling my insurance company to a. On 3 mg I felt nothing, no nausea, but +loose stools. When I went to 7 mg I felt nausea for 1 hour after taking the pill and decreased appetite the rest of the day. I am easily staying on my 1400-1500 calorie diet, which has never been easy for me in the past.  At 1 month of 7 mg I’ve lost 8 pounds (255 to 247) and very encouraged.

I take it around 6 am with a small amount of water as directed and then breakfast around an hour later. I have lost 14 lb in weight but I have started eating very healthy with a low carb intake. My appetite has reduced and my portion sizes have reduced as I do feel much fuller for longer.

"My dr. put me on Rybelsus as I had high blood sugar. I had too much difficulty taking the 3 mg with nausea, diarrhea, and Headache. I planned to quit but I read the reviews here. I somehow managed my symptoms and tried harder. My dr. then increased dosage to 7 mg. Rybelsus was able to bring my blood sugar levels from 10.6 to 5.6 almost normal levels in a period of 3 months. If anyone planning to quit please persevere and the results are amazing. It practically stops your cravings for food and helps you stabilize. Another miracle was that I was finally able to quit coffee in the morning as I get migraine without it. Compared to the nausea and diarrhea and the churning of the stomach, migraine wasn't big of a deal and I finally went without taking coffee. This is really a miracle drug for Diabetes. Thank you.",10.0,Rybelsus
My A1c has been hovering around 7 and my weight was creeping up so my doc suggested this. I started on the 3 and the nausea and projectile vomiting was rough...indeed I didn’t think I could handle it. Then I discovered if I take it when I wake in the small hours to pee if I took it then I had almost no problems. I’m now up to the 15mg dose and so far I’ve gone from around 255lb to about 220lb and falling. Two whole jean sizes...haven’t done new labs yet...but the weight loss is remarkable...it’s also quite weird to essentially almost never feel hungry anymore,8.0,Rybelsus
"I started on Rybelsus and only took 4 doses. I didn’t get terrible stomach upset but my abdomen went completely numb. I’ve been off of the medication for 4 days and am still completely numb. Went to ER and they ran blood work and CAT scan, all was normal. I went to chiropractor and again all was normal. Numbness is listed as  rare side effect on drugs.com website which my chiropractor looked up. My endocrinologist isn’t helpful, and I called Rybelsus and they were less than helpful. I’ve now spent hundreds of dollars. I’m very concerned and praying this goes away. I am so numb it hurts to touch my skin. Beware of this medication!",1.0,Rybelsus

My appetite has decreased, I don't pick/ snack and my portion size has decreased. 
I only ever feel nauseous if I eat too much, but I've got to grips with how much I can eat and to be honest, I don't really feel hungry. I was eating because I felt I should. No other side effects. On my second month so will see how it goes.",8.0,Rybelsus
"Was placed on this medication to help with PCOS caused insulin resistance and obesity. The first two months were a bit uncomfortable - I was nauseated a lot and had bouts of constipation and diarrhea. Fortunately, immediately starting it, my sugar cravings disappeared. 

I think I had a rough couple of months because of my old eating habits since this medicine slows how fast your stomach empties. As I developed better eating habits this has gone away completely.

I’ve been on this for almost a year now and have lost almost 60lbs. I’m about 5 lbs away from being a normal weight and I’m barely making any effort at this point; the weight is just coming off. I feel the healthiest I’ve felt in over a decade and have been seeing my PCOS symptoms reduce as the weight comes off. This medicine was a miracle for me.

"Started Rybelsus when it first came out in October 2019.
Took 3 mg at first and my glucose levels started to rise.  Changed to 14mg and was on that for 6 mos.  Glucose went very low - I was tired and weak. 
A1C went from 10.1 to 5.2.
Changed to 7 mg. and feel so much better, glucose levels are still within normal limits.
I've had no side-effects and great results.
I do take this with 5mg of Glipizide - once a day.  Have tried many diabetic drugs and Rybelsus has worked the best.  I've had a slight weight loss ...under 10lbs.  So glad I tried this drug.  It's a winner in my book.",10.0,Rybelsus

I started the 7 mg after a month and while I've been experiencing constipation, I am so happy about the weight loss. I've been on Rybesus for 10 weeks and have lost 10 lbs. My latest random glucose test had me at 5.7, down from 6.3 - 7 over the previous few months. I am happy about fewer carb cravings and will stay on Rybelsus as long as I can.

"Using Rybelsius was a nightmare for me. I have insulin resistance, and my doctor wanted to bring my A1C down below 6. 
First, it caused me to GAIN 10 lbs while I was on the 3mg. I thought once I started the 7mg, the weight would finally start to come off. Nope.
If that wasn't bad enough, I was lucky enough to experience one of the rare side effects...nerve damage.  My left leg started feeling like I had sciatica. It got a lot worse from there. Nerve damage not only affects the damaged area but your brain as well. It took about 4 months before I began to feel normal.  I had quit the Rybelsius as soon as I realized what was happening to me.

Had nauseousness so bad at start of each new dose increase, my Dr gave me nausea medication that helped. I’ve lost 30#. Afraid at this point I’ll have to stop & go to insulin. My A1C has gone down but not enough. Disappointed. Wish Rybelsus would continue to work for me.",8.0,Rybelsus
"I've been taking Rybelsus, along with metformin and Farxiga, for over 3 months. I had some minor diarrhea/constipation with the 3 mg that worked itself out quickly but I lost over 5lbs and A1C went down over 1pt (8.3 to 7.2). Just started the 7mg dose 5 days ago. So far the diarrhea is a lot worse and I'm having a lot of dizziness/nausea/fatigue/headaches but I'm hoping it'll stop soon. I seem to start feeling worse about 5-6hrs after taking the pill, so I'm sick in bed for hours in the afternoon and evening lately. Not good, as I'm a disabled housewife with two special needs adult children who depend on me. Not sure how someone who works a 9 to 5 job would be able to handle this transition period. If it doesn't sort itself out within a couple of weeks, I'll call my doctor. One tip, keep some saltine crackers and eat a few every hour or so. I know, against diabetic diet, but that and plenty of water helps the nausea.",8.0,Rybelsus
"First, I started on Rybelsus the 3mg dose, my blood sugar went UP over 200  I stopped on the third day went back to my old meds and my levels returned to normal. No nausea, no diarrhea no side effects of any kind. (I did follow the directions to take it first thing on an empty stomach and not eat for thirty minutes). Dr. switched me to 7 mg dose, so far my blood sugar is running higher than my old meds, I am on day four so I want to give it plenty of time. I do notice a lack of appetite. At this points I am not impressed but I am willing to give it more time before throwing in the towel.",5.0,Rybelsus
I have Pre-diabetes and obesity and started on the 3mg dose for first month and then moved to 7 mg.  I was very nauseous and found I could eat very little.  I had no appetite.  Great for weight loss but I felt really bad.  Maybe two weeks into the 7 mg dose it was a little better.  Then doc wanted me to move to 14 mg.  I don't like  to throw up and it became too much for me to tolerate.  I asked to go back down to the 7mg dose and have done fine on that ever since.  Definitely still keeps appetite in check.  5 months in and I’ve lost 35 pounds.  Also showing improvement in my blood sugar levels.,8.0,Rybelsus
I have been on Rybelsus for 1.5 months.   Can’t eat and what I do eat makes me so nauseous that it all comes back up.   I have lost 10 lbs which is great but if this upset stomach and throwing up does not go away then it is not worth it.   I’ll give it another week but I think I will tell the dr I am done.  My sugar levels were high and that is why he prescribed to take along with Synjardy.  Feeling sick all the time is   Not worth it.,6.0,Rybelsus
"I began taking this drug in late August 2020. It was prescribed to me by an endocrinologist to address significant weight gain over the prior two years (partially thanks to anxiety medication). The weight gain had pushed me into prediabetes, which was scary. After four and a half months, I've lost 20 lbs through reduced appetite (no real exercise). I have also seen my blood sugar levels drop. There have been occasional side effects: constipation, stomach pain, nausea.

Did not take another one. Today is day 4 that I'm off the pills and I still vomited this morning. And this set my diarrhea issues with metformin backwards. Very upset as I don't think I needed this. I've never had these types of issues, terrible.",2.0,Rybelsus
"I've notice a significant change in my blood sugar levels, so I am very glad that I can control my diabetes a little more easily without having to make any major lifestyle changes. 
My appetite has definitely dropped, which I wouldn't expect to be possible, but I'm positive this will help me on my weight loss journey as I'm only eating 2 snacks a day. (Yes, snacks. Not full meals) and have a lower carb and calorie intake. 
However, the nausea is unreal. I'm assuming I'll eventually get used to it and I won't be bothered, but for now it's been somewhat uncomfortable. 
As far as weight loss, so far after 3 weeks I have lost about 2-5 pounds. My scale also sucks so that's likely inaccurate, but I'm trusting that I'm steadily losing weight. Just got another 65 pounds to go!",9.0,Rybelsus

 I took the 3mg at 7am and all started out good it controlled my appetite and I felt fine, then around 3pm I started feeling chest pains, not severe just steady pinches for about 12 hours until 3am, I got extreme anxiety (which I never get) and was unable to sleep until around 8am the next day, still did not feel hungry the whole next day and then the diarrhea came and lasted around 6 hours.

Felt tired all the time, trouble sleeping and my stomach always feels full. I don't have much of an appetite either and oh boy, diarrhea the first 3 days almost seems like you can't leave the house and almost like uncontrollable, need to stay near the thrown.  4-5 days later, the diarrhea seems to be better but the nausea and vomit feelings keep me away from this meds.  Also, if anyone like to try this meds, I suggest getting some ginger chew candy, it does help the nausea feelings.

"I used Rybelsus for 6+ months. I had no problem adjusting to the medication; the 3-, 7-, and 14-mg steps worked for me just great. 
I didn’t care for how it had to be taken, first thing in the morning and then wait half an hour before having breakfast or coffee. If it had been effective for me, I could’ve lived with that, though. 
Over 6+ months, it had no effect on my blood sugar.
The reason I got off it was that my pharmacy didn’t have it available for an immediate refill, and I had to wait three days to get it. During those three days, I felt like a veil lifted: it was kind of like “coming to” myself and saying, “Oh! there you are!  Where have you been?” I seemed to be in kind of a fog while I was taking Rybelsus and doing absolutely nothing. I was scared to resume taking the medication because I didn’t want to fall into that state again and not even realize it.",1.0,Rybelsus

"My A1C was slowly creeping up and at 6.9 the Dr wanted to start Rybelsus (3 mg). I took it exactly as directed. The side effects were immediate:  constipation followed by diarrhea and extreme nausea. As I continued on the medication, nausea was constant and actually turned into stomach pain. If I ate anything, my stomach hurt worse and I started to have an aversion to food.  Any activity or exercise that involved using my core my muscles was very painful. Still, I persevered knowing that it can take a few weeks to adjust to a medication.  But, in week 3, after side effects continued to worsen and I vomited for several days in a row, I stopped the medication. I have been off for 3 weeks now and my stomach has not returned to normal as I have constant discomfort and it hurts after eating. I lost 10 lbs in 3 weeks, but it came at a high cost. The physical side effects were extreme and I hope I have not permanently harmed my body. I can still only eat a few bites at any one time. Beware!",,Rybelsus

I increase my dose in a few days to 7mg per direction. I have a decreased appetite and only eat one healthy meal and drink a lot of fluid. I was nauseated during the first week of taking but I just took as prescribed in the AM and wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking. I have a coffee every day in the AM. I eat my main sensible meal in the AM or at lunch. I can’t eat anything else and tbh food is not my go to any longer. I am no longer eating the white foods but I am eating well. I walk 2-3 times a week and I feel great. I have not had a test of my A1C but will at my next Dr. appt. I got a coupon from Rybelsus and my cost went from $24 to $10. I am very pleased with this med and not sure I need the 7mg because I may not even want food.  I also have high blood pressure which has decreased significantly.,10.0,Rybelsus

Dr put me on Glimiperide to quickly lower my sugar.  That helped me to manage cravings, feel better, eat better, and start walking.  My blood sugar would drop to low though and I would have to eat to bring it up.  Dr took me off that and put me on Rybelsus in addition to Metformin.  I have not had any side effects other than decreased appetite, especially now that I’m on 7 mg.  Its been almost 2 months on Rybelsus and I now weigh 189lb.

I get some pretty extreme nausea whenever I eat junk food (fatty and/or sugary), but otherwise feel good.  I'm hoping that the nausea I do get helps instil better long-term eating habits.  I've also experienced appetite suppression, which has helped me prioritize proteins and vegetables.  I did get alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea when starting this medicine, and am expecting that I'll experience the same with the dose increase.

I started Rybelsus, 3 mg, about 6 weeks ago and after 3 weeks felt so bad I stopped taking it. 
The worst feeling was quite bad lower back pain and a sort of fatigue. It was a generally weird feeling of malaise not just fatigue.
So if an introductory dose of just 3mg is any indication a stronger dose would be terrible for me.
So now I am on the max doseage of Metformin and my last A1c was 7.6.
7 years ago it was 6.5.
I would add that at most I have been about 15lbs overweight and there has never been any incidence of Diabetes in my family.",1.0,Rybelsus

Continuous nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy and horrible constipation were my friends during the time I took the drug and for about a week afterwards. I ended up in ER with terrible IBS with very painful cramps. I thought I had a blockage from no BMs for 12 days.

"Well I am on month 2 of Rybelsus and on 2nd week of 7 mg. I posted my experience last month, as well. I am 20 lbs overweight and pre-diabetic for many years. Diabetic runs in my family.  I am 60 years old, active and healthy otherwise. Unfortunately, I do not experience much of anything towards my goal of weight loss. I am slightly nauseous, at times. I am constipated.  I am not on any other diabetic medication. I weigh 1 lb less but this could be attributed to margin of errors.  I am planning to continue using this medication and see what happens once I am on 14 mg. Considering all the potential serious side effects (thyroid cancer, pancreatitis and more…), this needs to give anyone better results.  I believe that people respond differently to everything… so great to those who do well on Rybelsus.  See you next time with better news. Stay safe.",3.0,Rybelsus
"Hi All,
It is 11 pm right now, and I should be sleeping, so I can go to work in the morning. Instead, I am here, trying to see if anyone else has anxiety and the feeling of a lump in their throat. 
Today is my second day taking Rybelsus (3mg), for weight management. I had 2 anxiety attacks yesterday, and 4, today. The feeling of a lump in my throat makes me go down a rabbit hole and consequently, I have anxiety/panic attacks. 
Will this feeling of having a lump in my throat go away? Further, will the anxiety/panic attacks abate?
I truly hope these things go away.
I don't know if I can recommend this medication at this point.",1.0,Rybelsus

I had quit for two months and the side pain was fine and my gastro issues were normal again. I restarted the Rybelsus back and ended up with the same issues all over again.

It took me that first month on the 3 mg for my body to get used to this med and I almost stopped due to the nausea and stomach up I had, but I powered through and by the time I started my second month using the 7 mg, the stomach issues had disappeared. My only complaint has been the constipation I've suffered from after taking this drug for so long. I simply take stool softeners every night to deal with the problem.

"Hello Guys,
Being a biomedical scientist I am doing too much research on meds and get scared and become very resistant to trying anything when I read the side effects. I dropped my A1C from 10 to 8.5 just by diet during the pandemic and was thrilled. But going back to work and being indulgent with stress now it went up to 11 and I was prescribed Rybelsus. Within 10 days I dropped about 8 lbs, my weight was constant for a year before that. I did start a restricted diet with it and ramped up my exercise as I was very unhappy with my A1C. I am excited with this jump start but also a bit scared for a weight loss that fast. I will appreciate to hear from others if they had similar experience. I am hoping it will stabilize and I will lose more weight but slowly which is always the safest. I have noticed that I am not hungry I am very excited about that, but my stomach is queasy and I have diarrhea . My morning sugar is always high but it came down to 108 with the 3mg.",7.0,Rybelsus

I have been all Rybelsus over three months now.  Initially I saw multiple doctors with a complaint of chronic diarrhea while on Metformin. No one would consider taking me off of the Metformin. Finally I went to a teaching facility and they did stop it and they put me on the Rybelsus. No problems at all with a 3 mg and then we went to 7 mg. My taste buds suddenly changed and I could not eat anything that was greasy or sweet and I could not eat any meat. From the diarrhea I lost 30 pounds. I have also been weak and tired every day. I have weird nightmares and I am now walking and talking in my sleep . I have been on the 14 mg for two weeks now and I was fine up until yesterday. It was as though I could feel my belly swelling up with gas and it was very painful. Diarrhea has now turned to constipation.

Now on Victoza I have seen a fasting blood sugar in the 85 to 105 range this week.  As an added bonus I lost 6 pounds in six days.  Hopefully the long term prospects are as favorable as the short term ones have been.",9.0,Victoza
"When my A1C reached a 9 in Nov. 2022, my PCP asked me if I was interested in taking Victoza to lower my A1C, and I happily agreed. I started at 0.6 and moved to 1.8 within a month. I have lost 105 lbs (300 lbs in Nov 22 to 195 in Nov 23). I've had no side effects from Victoza. My diabetes is pretty much gone, except my A1C is still a little high (5.8 to 6.1). I continue to be ravenous for sweet/fatty food, BUT the Victoza enables me to delay eating or skip meals without my body punishing me for not eating. I have the ability to choose when and what I eat. Before Victoza, dieting would give me headaches and other physical symptoms. With Victoza, I feel more 'normal' in my ability to eat healthy meals or skip meals entirely. I went from 5x clothes (300 lbs) to wearing XL clothes today at 195 lbs. I'm much happier, my health is much better, and people marvel at how much weight I have lost. I'm very happy to have been offered Victoza.",10.0,Victoza
"I started with Bydureon at first for about a month and started having lumps at the injection sites, so the Dr switched me to Victoza.  For the first 2 weeks I had a lot of nausea but after that it leveled out and I started feeling great.  So after 3 months I have lost 52 pounds!  My appetite has decreased and for the first time I can eat a small portion and feel full.  NO more cravings immediately after I finish eating. I love this medication.  My blood sugar levels have been between 89-94.",10.0,Victoza
"I have officially been on Victoza for more than a year...I currently take highest dose of 1.8. along with Metformin daily. My A1C is finally normal @ 5.0 - my sugars never higher than 7.0 (even after meals) - I've yet to ever experience a episode of hypoglycemia.
After a year there is 45 lbs less of me :) and my desire to be active/healthy again has returned.
I will encourage those that Victoza alone is not solely the answer.....I have family members who also went on Victoza, did not follow diet/exercise and or portion control and the drug only made them feel worse and had no effects. I personally found Victoza a great tool in combo with portion/diet/exercise to truly be the answer I'd been waiting for! Worth a try if you are serious...",9.0,Victoza

I can't eat more then 1 cup of food without feeling miserably full. No desire to over eat at all.  So far so good.  Hoping I don't plateau.

"For me, Victoza was a life-changing drug. For decades, I struggled with unexplained hunger and weight gain. I had every possible test done. Finally, after tests showed a slightly elevated A1c, I suggested to my doctor we try Victoza. And it worked. Yes, there was nausea. But the medication actually worked BETTER the longer I was on it. I attribute this to loss of appetite, (after several months, I no longer experienced the raging hunger I once did). I admit that nausea continues to be a problem (and the only side effect), so I’ll try decreasing Victoza to 1.2, then .6 if that doesn’t work. Despite the nausea, the drug has been well-worth it for me. I finally feel like myself again. I guess what I’m saying is, “Don’t lose hope!”",9.0,Victoza

I had debilitating nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and those horrible sulfur burps and gas that ran everyone away from me and sent me to the ER thinking my insides were deteriorating! LOL! But by day 6, the side effects subsided. I lost 10 lbs within the first 3 days. Tomorrow I have to increase the dosage, but I'm praying that I won't have to deal with the side effects again.

I started with 0.6mg and on 4th day increased to 1.2mg. Still no side effects. I recommend this med for people with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

I feel the weight loss would have been even more significant had I eaten right from the get go.  This medication can especially help those with POCS lose weight by slowing down your digestion and keeping you fuller longer.  The last month I really put in the effort of cutting my calories and allowing the medication do it's thing without increasing my activity.  This is the fastest weight loss I have ever seen even with restricting calories and daily gym visits.  My a1c went from 6.6 to the 6.1, and glucose 90..it's never been that low.

For the most part the side effects pretty much sibsided after the first month.  As long as I eat properly I feel really good.  If I eat something I shouldn't, especially something fatty, it makes me nauseous.  Processed foods do not taste good at all.  I find myself actually craving healthier foods like plain chicken and vegetables and steering clear of things with sauces or heavily flavoured foods.  I am seldom hungry and now eat approximately half what I used to eat.  Blood sugar levels have improved and in  ten weeks I have lost 30 pounds.",9.0,Victoza

I have been plagued by nausea and fatigue this first week.  We'll see what tonight's increase to 1.2 mg brings.  I also began to exercise on a daily basis.  I started out slow, and will continue to increase my activity.  My clothes are fitting me better, but I don't know exactly how much weight I've lost.

I have been taking Victoza now for about a month. I'm a relatively newly diagnosed diabetic. I found out two months ago. I was on 1000mg Metformin twice a day. Even on the Metformin my sugars would be 280-400. Even waking up in the morning fasting I would be in the 240-270 range. So in our first checkup my doctor suggested Victoza. Holy crap. What a difference. On the first day with only the .6 dose I had my first sugar below 200. I have had no negative side effects at all. I ramped up to the max dose in the first week because I was feeling great. I still have no negative side effects. My appetite is significantly reduced. Post meal sugars in the 120-140 range. 90 or less in the AM. Love this med!!!!,10.0,Victoza

With Victoza I have lost 5 lbs. At first I was a little nauseous. My appetite has decreased. YEAH! The nausea has gone away now and my readings remain very good.

Recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and started out with metformin. Metformin did nothing to control my blood sugar. Was put on Victoza and within 3 days blood sugars were normal but have terrible indigestion with horrible rotten egg smell. Got to talk to my doc about that. But I have lost 30 pounds in 2 months while on Victoza. No nausea. But I don't have an appetite which has caused me to eat way less food. Im taking the 1.6 mg dose.

My bad eating habits made me gain 5 kg's. I'm on my first week of using Victoza again and already lost 2.5kg for the first week! If you really want results for weight loss, eat a healthy balanced diet. I know my body doesn't like red meat - so I'm on veggies, fruits, nuts, eggs and rice products.

I have been taking Victoza since February of 2017. At first I had nausea and constipation. I upped dose to 1.2 and was really feeling bad. When I went up to 1.8 it was continually making me feel sick. My doctor told me to go back to 1.2. After a week on the 1.2 things started getting better. I still have the nausea but it is only sometimes. The constipation I solved by taking a stool softener. I feel full after eating about a 4th of what I used to. Sometimes just the thought of food makes me feel queasy. The best thing is the weight loss. I started out weighing 323 lbs. I went to the doctor today and my weight is down to 280. It feels so good to lose weight without feeling hungry. A1-c number went down from 9.3 to 6.6.,,Victoza

It also had the opposite effect of the 1.2mg which gave me severe diarrhea the 0.6mg actually gives me normal BMs since I already have an ongoing GI issue with diarrhea. I honestly love it! I was told doctors don’t prescribe .6mg because no clinical studies weren’t done on this dosage, but this seriously worked great in 3 months. I’m giving it a 9/10 because I still get annoying gas and painful stomach cramps now and again, which can be annoying.",9.0,Victoza

With regard to food, I eat smaller, choose better/more balanced food, I have lost around 10kg in total in this time and this alone has made a huge difference. I also consume pre/probiotics daily now and this helped with the GI disturbances.

As for side effects, I had nausea, dizzy spells, gut ache/cramps, reflux, felt rather tired in the first 2 weeks. All dissipated in the first 4 weeks. At the time I told myself I prefer to feel like this in the short term than head into a future potentially suffering from the plethora of illness brought about by Type 2 Diabetes.

You cannot eat what you were use to, your stomach is half full to begin with.  So with alot of trial and error you will figure out the eating habits to prevent the reflux and such.

So when the urine dries or isn't cleaned/wiped away properly we are prone to infection. Just my two cents and hope it helps you.",8.0,Jardiance
"I've been put on this drug at first it felt like I was going to get a urinary tract infection for almost a week then that went away. I noticed then I started losing weight and my blood sugar went down. I love this drug because it keeps my weight down and sugar down.

I called my physician. They had me to discontinue the medication and come immediately to the office. He stopped this medication and I'm trying to flush my system.

I have been on Jardiance one year now in conjunction with a ketogenic diet with no ill effect. I noticed a small increase in urination but not more than 2-3 times a day extra. I have gotten off all my insulin (400 units a day) and lost over 100 pounds with no exercise. A1c has gone from 12 to 5.5. Recently I started getting excessive fatigue and my Dr didn't think I needed the higher dose anymore so I dropped to 10mg. The key I think is being very low carb to begin with. You can't take this drug and eat a SAD diet full of carbs. Carbs will just raise your blood sugars and spike insulin which will result in the medication making you pee more and more to get rid of it. All that sugar pee will just result in yeast infections.  It's a good drug but not magic. You have to be responsible for what and how you eat which if you're diabetic means as little carbs as possible with no snacking.,9.0,Jardiance
"These drug Jardiance seemed like a godsend when I first started taking it around 9 months ago. At first I was on 10mg and the only symptom I was having was excessive thirst and I could handle that but in the last 4 months since an increase to 25mg I have been suffering constantly with a yeast infection. I even spoke to my Doctor about it and had a weeks course of Fluconazole which helped for less than a week and now even after creams and tablets I still have a yeast infection that will not go away and a UTI. Before I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 in 2018 I had never had a UTI or a YI but now I suffer constantly.

The long term side effects are also a worry as no one really knows what they are capable of. I know one thing though, I cannot continue with this medication.",1.0,Jardiance

I  haven't seen that number since before I was diagnosed several years ago. My numbers now stay in the low 100s all day as well, even after eating. Now, I am also eating very low carb, so that may have a lot to do with it. I don't notice extra urination, but I always urinated a lot with such high blood sugars so to me there's no difference. No infections yet, but as I stated it's only day 3. I would have to agree with the other poster who said this drug works best (or only) for those eating a low-carb diet.

"I’ve been on Jardiance for 6 months.  It’s lowered my blood sugar levels significantly and I’ve had none of the joint pains that others have mentioned.

The constant itching and thrush can be off putting but I found when I ate lower carb the symptoms decreased.  Also I was given a tip to use water wipes or a flannel with water to wipe after urinating as this washes away any residual sugar in ‘that’ area.  It’s helped dramatically.  Also I order Clotrimazole online very cheaply and use when needed to keep on top of a flare up.

When I eat badly the urinating and itching is worse as there’s more sugar to pee out.

My blood sugars are pretty good and my A1c is 6.3 but that was never a problem.  I have also lost 35lbs without changing my diet or any real exercise besides short walks that I always did.  I am really questioning why my previous doctor never put me on any thing besides metformin when I complained about high blood sugars for YEARS!  He said, ",,Jardiance
I have taken Jardiance for a little over a year.  At first good results.  Then I began to feel the constant need to urinate and could not go an hour without having to pee.  This was followed by back and abdomen pain which felt like an UTI.    My urine sample did not indicate an infection though I was given an antibiotic while they cultured my sample.  I stopped taking Jardiance and the pain and the constant need to urinate (sometimes painfully) ceased within 3 days.  I cannot help but wonder what damage the drug may have done to my kidneys and urinary track.  My doctor never even suggested stopping as I had to do my on research to see that this was one of the side effects of the drug.,3.0,Jardiance
