"I usually dont share reviews but felt this was warranted.   I took my first 2. 5 mg shot on 94,  felt fine until 97 when the terrible sulfur burps started followed by sour stomach and nausea.   Around 10 pm that night I began 5 days of severe vomiting and diarrhea which culminated yesterday at the ER getting fluids,  CT scans,  and IV nausea meds.   I will not be taking this shot again I have not thrown up anymore but the diarrhea will just not stop.  I cant eat or take any of my other medication properly.   Beware.   When something sounds too good to be true it usually it is.   Im a past user of byetta,  victoza,  ozempic,  trulicity,  rybellsus,  bydureon,  all the pills,  and and about every homeopathic treatment ever made.   I didnt take this shot like a blind fool but I have never had a side effect as terrible as this case.     Ill stick with my insulin.  At least I can function like a normal human being!

"I started with this medication for weight loss and since I am 58 and a diabetic,  my insurance covered it.   It is a fantastic weight loss drug for me.   Starting at 5'6 242lbs.  I have lost 23 pounds in 12 weeks.  I don not remember when I was able to lose this much weight.   I have dieted my whole life and finally gave up and ballooned to 242lb.   You have to be careful about eating greasy food and to not over eat.   I did vomit a few times after eating greasy food.   Other than that,  I am so excited.   My first goal is to get to 180 and see what happens.   My feet no longer hurt when I stand all shift. ",Tirzepatide 
"This is my 2nd time posting.   Was on Trulicity in the past  now Mounjaro 5mg,  7. 5mg  bumped to 12. 5.   Effects for me are minimal  not bad,  at all.   Some days the acid reflux or constipation is bad,  but it is not way off the charts  is manageable.   One thing I noticed,  as my doctor progressed me up the ladder to higher doses of Mounjaro. . . the weight loss is amp'ing up.   Gradually starting to lose more per week than when on lower doses.   Also,  on 5 mg  7. 5mg,  I noticed on days 1 4,  I wasn not hungry AT ALL  knew that I needed to eat therefore,  I thought of food as FUEL,  not just tasty  I made betterhealthier choices.   Now,  on 12. 5mg,  I find days 1 5 or 6. . . . I am not hungry at all  still making better food choices,  because I have to make myself eat.   The in between meals snacking has totally GONE AWAY.   This drug has been a miracle for me,  as my Thyroid Hashimoto is has caused so much weight gain wthe slower metabolism  I couldn not lose any weight until Mounjaro.   It is a blessing! ",Tirzepatide 
I was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss.  I took my first 2. 5mg dose on Friday 916.  Today is Sunday two days later and I have yet to feel anything different.  I dont feel full and theres no lack of desire to eat.  I feel the same as I always have.  I wonder if I did the shot right.  I dont know maybe it takes a moment to kick in.  I see people saying they lost weight in the first week Im not sure how thats possible if I dont have appetite suppression.  I guess time will tell. ,Tirzepatide 
"I was on Mounjaro for 2 months.  I had side effects of lower back pain,  increased thirst and decreased urine output.  I increased my fluid intake.  Cut out all sugary drinks and foods.  Barely could eat.  I was on 5 mg.  I woke 1162023 vomiting black coffee like grounds.  Go to the ER that afternoon and was admitted.  After many labs scans I found out my liver was in shock.  All liver enzymes were elevated.  I am talking 1100 numbers elevated from what the normal is 40 ish.  My liver was on the way to shutting down.  My body was shutting down.  GI BLEED as well.  Do not take this medication.  There is not enough information! ! ! ",Tirzepatide 
"I completed 4 weeks on 2. 5 mg with zero side effects,  other than the intended appetite suppression and lost 10 pounds.  HOWEVER after my second week at 5mg I am not sure I can continue,  I have had awful nausea,  vomiting,  sulfur burps,  and diarrhea,  to the point I had to go to the ER for IV fluids and potassium.  Zofran,  Phenegran,  Tums and Pepto have zero effect.  I can barely function,  but hey,  I am down a total of 17lbs in 6 weeks,  so at least I will look skinny for my next trip to the ER. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started on 2. 5 mg 3 weeks ago.  Im 52 and starting weight was 175. 4,  my highest was 180.  I decided to try medication  after my waist was 39 inches. 
 After my 3rd injection,  I am now 165 and lost 3 inches off my waist .  This is with minimal exercise and mostly appetite suppression.  Bacon and eggs that I have eaten faithfully as part of an attempt at the keto diet,  I just cant eat.  Food is unappealing.  Ive struggled 2x this week to reach 1200 calories.  That has never happened to me before.  
Side effects indigestion,  fatigue

Hoping this continues to work with minimal adverse events.  Ive been gaining losing the same 3 5 pounds since my daughters birth 5 years ago.  This makes sticking to a meal plan so much easier.  My binge eating during shark week  had gotten out of control.  Id like to add my kettlebell training back,  hoping I get some energy back. ",Tirzepatide 
I have had A1C. . 11. . . after two months of using  Mounjaro it is  now 7 and I have been losing 2 or three pounds a week.  A friend took picture of me and I actually saw the weight loss.  I am 64 years old.  I have had high blood sugar and pressure for over 10 years so it is more than just nice to be normal.  Thank you Mounjaro medicine helped with both,Tirzepatide 
"Started taking 2. 5 last Thursday.  Day 1 no side effects,  day 2 mild nausea,  day 3 everything broke loose!  Dizzy spells,  clammy sweats,  severe abdominal pains,  and bloating.  Ended up in ER and blood pressure was so high I was at stroke level!  Readings were 220123,  187113,  197116,  178112!  No issues before medication!  Beware this medication is so new there is no telling show many other side effects it can have!  I pray this mess gets out of my system soon! ",Tirzepatide 
"Started 1026.  Weight 245,  female.  2. 5 1x,  5,  1x,  10mg,  last 2 months.  Current 214.  Zero exercise unfortunately.  I have read so many reviews and I am baffled at all these bad side effects,  since mine were so minor except constipation and tiredness day after injection.  Learned early,  no sugar,  breads,  or pastapotato.  I take no other meds,  do a strict low carb and fast.  I have a protein shake at noon,  a meat and a LC veg for dinner small portion always,  then freeze a protein shake for two hours and it makes ice creamish.  Delish!  Thats all I eat daily.  Hunger is now fully controllable!  My A1C started at 6. 7,  BUT I was on low carb for 6 weeks prior to blood work so likely much higher in general.  Last weeks blood test showed A1C at 5. 0.  My ALT SGPT liver was high last test,  and normal range this time.  What did go up was my top 4 CBC numbers.  Overall,  this is a game changer.  So grateful.  I truly believe eating right is the key when on this med.  Hope this helps someone. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am a Type 2 diabetic.  I have been on Mounjaro for several months.  It is controlling my blood sugar great,  and I have lost some weight.  My biggest problem with the Mounjaro is the fact that I cannot get it because of unavailability.  I don not understand how people who want to lose weight take priority over people with a medical condition.  The people with diabetes need this medication and are not able to get their prescriptions filled because the people who want to lose weight are hoarding this medication.  I also want to lose weight,  however,  the control of my blood sugars is a priority to me.  I cannot control my blood sugars without my medication.  Something needs to be done so that diabetics can control the disease.  Obesity is not a disease,  but diabetes is.  Mounjaro is a great medication for type 2 diabetics for controlling their blood sugar.  Availability for diabetics should be a priority. ",Tirzepatide 
Im type 2 diabetic and was on Ozempic for quite sometime and having difficulty getting my med.  My doctor changed me to Mounjaro for my diabetes thinking I would be able to get my meds.  I started on the 5mg since I had been on Ozempic.  My side effects were typical slight nausea.   I was trying to get my 2nd month filled and the issues started with availability AGAIN.  The 5mg and 7. 5mg were on backorder.   He increased my dose to 10mg.  I have experienced sulfur burps but that is about it.  I have not seen much weight loss but then again Im more concerned about my diabetes.  Shame on the drug companies for dangling a med that works to lower A1C and cholesterol and choosing to utilize it for weight loss where the insurance wont cover it.  Im not using this med for vanity its for my chronic disease. ,Tirzepatide 
"I am a 6'2,  46 year old male who started his journey at 305 lbs.  My doctor prescribed me Mounjaro 10. 0 in Jan.  of 2023.  In Dec.  of 2023,  I went to level 12. 5.  Mounjaro,  along with a balanced diet and exercising 4 5 days a week,  changed my life for the better.  I went from a 'Living to Eat' person to an 'Eating to Live' person.  Mounjaro helps me mentally and physically.  After I eat,  I feel fuller longer,  and I don not get food cravings.  It is amazing! !  I went from 305 lbs to 238 lbs.  That is 67 lbs in 13 14 months.  I am off all insulin.  I stopped snoring at night.  I am participating in 5K races.  Achieving goals and having fun!  Team Gavin,  I treat my body like a football team   Offense   gym four to five days a week,  Defense   portion control,  Special Teams   Mounjaro injections once a week.  I don not think I could be doing this well without all three.  The journey continues for me,  and I hope after you read this,  it begins with you.  Good luck! ",Tirzepatide 
"I started Mounjaro to help control my blood sugar.   I had tried Ozempic and Trulicity and could not tolerate the nausea,  sulfur burps and stomach issues.  Mounjaro has been life changing.  No bad side effects.   Im not hungry,  I dont have cravings,  Im losing weight steadily,  and sweet desserts taste too sweet.   Many people say theyve had bad side effects with it.   I say try it as it may work for you.  Just like I couldnt use other meds that other people love.   For me it has been life altering. ",Tirzepatide 
I have been on 2. 5 mg for 5 weeks.   My starting weight was 263.   I have lost 15 lbs.  with no side effects.   My doctor has placed me on the 5 mg dosage.   Hopefully I will continue losing weight with no side effects. ,Tirzepatide 
"I started taking Mounjaro 91.  This resulted in the very worst month of my life.  WEEK ONE   Super Nauseous,  indigestion,  stomach pain 3 4 days of the first week.  My appetite went from a 10 to a 2.  Which was good WEEK TWO   I had diarrhea for 3 4 days,  along with sulfur belches,  nausea,  stomach pain. . . I ended up having to take sick days and going to get an IV bag to recover from the dehydration.  WEEK THREE   World class nausea and vomiting.  3 days of vomiting so hard that I ruptured my esophagus.   The entire month,  if I was not having diarrhea I was VERY constipated.  I lost 9 lbs in one month,  but I don not know if it was because I could barely eat because of the sickness.  

PASS! ! ",Tirzepatide 
Be careful when deciding to take this medication.  I advise you to speak first with your doctor and if you could find another way to lose weight you should decide to go with something else.  The side effects for some people are almost unbearable.  I was 100 healthy before taking this.  Now my blood sugar levels are low I can not wait for this to leave my system.  Its hard to work out I feel awful.  Ever since I stopped taking it since my sugar levels are low I have to eat more sugar and its hard to eat.  I feel nauseous and its so hard to start the day feeling like this.  Please beware I know of people that are not even eating while taking this because they lost their appetite and they have to blend their food because it wont go down.  The side effects at the beginning for many people are really awful.  If you have to work and be productive dont take this medicine you will regret it. ,Tirzepatide 
"Female age 56.  Started Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in February 2022.  Start weight was 249 pounds.  Today,  my weight is 162,  down a total of 87 pounds!  No more high blood pressure or high cholesterol.  My lower back pain that prevented me from walking for more than 5 minutes is gone.  I no longer get out of breath just trying to do normal everyday things.  I was very depressed and miserable due to the struggle of trying to live life being so overweight and basically semi handicapped.  I was very introverted and unhappy overall for decades due to being overweight and countless attempts to lose weight and not able to be successful and continued to gain.  Now I can walk for miles on end without any pain.  I can do things I did 25 years ago.  I got my life back.  Wish this drug was around many years ago but better late than never.  I am on a 15mg dosage.  If I get nausea the day after the shot,  I take a couple of tums and its gone.  I take a stool softener to combat hard stools and it does the trick. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am 6ft and started at 213lbs.  Blood sugars were a little elevated and I could see they were headed in the wrong direction.  I also have severe sleep apnea.  
I started 7. 5 and just finished my fourth week.   This drug is amazing.  Im down 24 lbs in 28 days.  Lost 4 lbs last week.  Current weight is 189lb.  Goal is 175lb.  I check my blood sugar 2 or 3 times a day.  My highest reading was 101 about an hour after eating.  Most readings in the low 80s which is perfect.   I couldnt have asked for more from this drug.  
Side effects are constipation drink lots of water and tired the day after the shot.  
Ive been slightly overweight my entire life.  I hope to lose this weight and then see if the sleep apnea goes away.   Life changing. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am now on the 10 mg dosage.  I was in fear of starting this regimen when my Dr.  suggested it was worth a try.  I finally agreed after months of bad test results on my A1c  liver enzymes.  I did not have the severe side effects that some have experienced.  I felt a little nauseous,  and quickly learned that I had to cut back on my food intake overall,  plus eat less foods that are hard for my body to digest.  I still get some uncomfortable feeling and tiredness about 2 days after the shot.  My A1c and liver enzymes were finally heading in a downtrend at my Dr.  appointment last month. . . the first in over 5 years.  I have lost approximately 21 lbs.  My weight loss is slow but that is fine with me.  I do not know what the future holds but so far this is working. ",Tirzepatide 
"Holy side effects.  

First,  if you eat when you take it,  it just sits in your stomach and youll be burping it for 12 hours.  

The headache is insane.  Starts immediately.  

Then you are hit with 3 days of nausea,  fatigue and just overall fatigue.  Just when you start to feel better,  cue the insane heartburn !  

It took me 5 days to feel normal again.  

Ill pass on this even though I lost 5 pounds the first week. ",Tirzepatide 
Constant nausea no matter what I eat.  Muscle weakness and tired all the time.  Im feeling mentally down.  Tomorrow will be my 3rd shot and Im seriously hoping these side effects go away so I can get type II diabetes under control.  Probably losing some weight because I dread the nausea after eating so am not eating as much.  The verdict is still out for me on this medicine. ,Tirzepatide 
"This is my fifth week and I started on 2. 5mg and now on 5. 0mg,  I have had only one side effect.  Dry mouth but I lost 29lbs the first month.  I weighed 243lbs and now I am down to 214lbs.  If you dont eat fried foods,  sugar,  or heavy carbs,  you will do great.  I dont overeat anymore,  plus exercise I walk 5 miles a day.  I drink at least 64fl oz water.  This medication is worth taking.  I had no issues at all.  And feel great.  I cant wait to fulfill my journey.  The key is to follow a plan.  You want a life change this is it!  I used the coupon and only certain pharmacies know how to code it.  I got lucky because My pharmacy worked with me. ",Tirzepatide 
"I saw this medication on TikTok  decided to try it.   Started on 2. 5mg  on 92322 at 204 pounds.   Had some chills  started feeling a little off,  light headed,  metallic taste in mouth,  major loss of appetite,  increased anxiety.  Continued through the 2. 5mg then moved up to 5. 0mg.   On my 4th injection of 5. 0mg my life flipped upside down.  This medication caused me some serious side effects,  syncope,  dehydration,  electrolytes to be out of sync,  chest pain  one heck of panic attack while at work  I had to be rushed to ER.    Very scary  thankful I was not driving when it happened.    I have stopped the medication immediately.   I want to feel normal again.  Down to 190 pounds now not worth the risk. ",Tirzepatide 
"This is my 2nd post,  I am on 7. 5 mg of Mounjaro and I have loved every moment of this journey.  I was 243 lbs and lost 49 lbs so far since October 2022.  I also eat a healthy diet and exercise.  Stay hydrated because my side effect is dry mouth and constipation.  I did however find out that if you eat carbs,  sugar,  or fried food you will get nauseous and possibly throw up.  Lesson learned.  Stick to protein and vegetables and fruit.  I need to lose 34 more lbs to be at my ideal weight.  I am still excited to be on this journey. ",Tirzepatide 
"I dont have diabetes.  I may have insulin resistance.  Im taking this for weight loss.   BMI 48.  Took first dose,  a sample dose,  five days ago.  I didnt even feel the needle.  Within a day of the injection I started having pain in my low back,  in the tailbone area,  squeezing muscle pain when standing or walking.  The pain goes away after a few minutes of sitting or lying down.  I had similar pain when taking Belviq.  I dont normally have back pain.  Also have some intermittent mild itching at wrists,  ankles. 

I still think about food all the time but Im not actually interested in eating it.  Someone brought me a quarter pounder sandwich for supper.  I had to cut it in half and then I shared my half with the cat.   Theres cake in the refrigerator and I havent touched it.  Im hungriest in the mid morning now and today had 1 low carb tortilla,  one link turkey sausage,  a slice of cheese,  cilantro,  and a bowl of watermelon. ",Tirzepatide 
"I tried Ozempic for 9 weeks and thought I was going to die,  so they switched me to Mounjaro.  The 1st 2 weeks were okay,  I just didn not have an appetite,  but week 3 hit me just like ozempic did.  Total exhaustion,  I have lost 5 lbs in little over 3 days,  
 I have side effects of sulphur burps,  dehydrated,  constant nausea,  falling to sleep at all times,  all night vomiting and diarrhea.  I feel bruised from head to toe and blurred vision.  I am telling people this for a warning.  Read the reviews.  People are constantly going to the ER because of these medications.  I am flustered because I found something that worked for my diabetes,  but  it is really bad for  me.  Since starting Ozempic up to now I have lost almost 30lbs. . .  might sound great but not when you can not function. ",Tirzepatide 
"I have been on Mounjaro since March 2023,  it is now February 2024.  When my doctor suggested Mounjaro to me,  I was at a point in my life where I didn not think it could get much worse.  My A1C was off the charts,  I was severely obese at 280 pounds,  and I was scheduling my 6th surgery in 7 months!  Now,  almost a year later,  my diabetes is gone!  I am 100 pounds down to 180 and no more surgeries in my foreseeable future!  Game changer! ",Tirzepatide 
"I know this med doesn not work for everyone and some people have some pretty horrific side effects.  Luckily,  I am one of those people who it DOES work for.  In 4 months,  went from A1C of 7. 5 to 5. 0.  All of my other regular labs are in normal range.  Going off atorvastatin 10mg for cholesterol and lisinopril 10mg for high blood pressure soon.  Also,  lost 45 lbs.  Only side effect worth mentioning is constipation,  but I think I finally have a handle on that with magnesium supplement.  Started on 2. 5mg for 8 shots,  5. 0mg the rest of the time.  My biggest problem is supply issues.  I have a prescription for 7. 5mg but haven not been able to find any yet.  Shortage is supposedly ending,  so hopefully that will be resoved soon. ",Tirzepatide 
"I was prescribed the 2. 5 dosage as a trial by my endocrinologist for pre diabetic and weight loss on 91522.   I felt fine the first day,  shot was given in the morning but the next day I actually forgot to eat lunch.   That is not normal for me.   I wasnt hungry.  The third and fourth day I had horrible sulphur burps,  nausea,  fatigue.  On the fourth day I took two naps which is not normal for me.   I thought my symptoms were getting worse but then the fifth and sixth day I felt great.  I am fearful to take the next injection this week as I dont want a repeat of the less than desirable side effects.  It really wrecked my weekend.   On the up side,  I lost a couple of pounds the first week.  Thats exciting but at what cost? ",Tirzepatide 
I began my journey 082322.  As of 011723 I am down 55lbs.  I have had no issues.  I truly have little to no desire to eat.  I have to force myself to eat.  My blood sugar is now normal to the low end.  I really hope that insurance will kick in before the coupon is no longer effective.  I am stunned by how well this has worked.  I have tried other meds and nothing has come close.  I am 11 lbs from my goal weight.  I think I and going to have to readjust my goal.  Yay! ,Tirzepatide 
"Started at the 2. 5 level and lost some weight.   15 lbs.   Sugars are down as well.   Greasy foods are not recommended.   Went to the 5. 0 level and everything dairy went bad. . . sours on the stomach badly,  and quickly.   Ate too much one night and got very ill,  vomiting and diarrhea all night along with serious gas from both ends!   I don not like  that I can not have my diary,  even tried Lactaid to no avail.   Also,  there seems to be a metallic taste in my mouth most of the time. ",Tirzepatide 
I started out of the 5mg and was deathly ill from it for about a week with severe diarrhea and  belching that was so awful it made me want to vomit.   I lost 9 pounds and my sugars are going down and staying where they are supposed to be.   I called my doctor and she switched me down to the 2. 5mg better just one day of illness.   Started back on the 5mg and I still feel horrible for 24 hours after day 2 of the shot.   But sugars are awesome and I am hoping this too will pass,Tirzepatide 
"Horrible experience taking this drug.  I do not recommend taking this medication unless you want to die.  I started taking 2. 5 mg 6 days ago.  Day 2 and 3 had no appetite and ate very little because the thought of food made me sick. Day 4 and 5 developed nausea,  severe abdominal pain and indigestion unrelieved by antacids. I also have lost five 1bs because I am unable to eat or drink  anything.  I do not have any energy or feel like doing anything.  Day 6 and I still feel sick.  My fasting Blood sugar this morning was 224 even though I  am not eating or drinking hardly anything at all.  It is noon and I havent eaten anything because Im afraid I will throw up.  My heart rate is 120 and normally runs in the eighties.  My doctor is out of the office this week for holidays.  Just hoping and praying I dont wind up in the emergency room.  I will never inject this toxic  stuff into my body again.  I also read that it can cause thyroid cancer. ",Tirzepatide 
Im a 2 type diabetes I have been on mounjaro since 101022 I have lost 56lbs and I havent had any major side effects.  I have been eating healthy and exercising 1 hr at day so it has helped me with weight and my blood sugar. ,Tirzepatide 
"I have been on Mounjaro for 9 weeks.  I had to jump from 5 to 10 mg last week due to shortage issues.  I am having several problems with severe bloating,  constipation,  headache,  and stomach pain.  I have severe gas that keeps me up most of the night and can be a sign of impending intermittent diarrhea at times.  I am always full and started pushing myself to eat as I can go all day with nothing.  Now I have small welts and itching at injection sites.  Total weight loss 0.   My blood sugar is higher especially in the morning.  This drug is horrible and I wont put my body through it anymore.  I can lose weight easier and healthier than this since it ruined my Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Years Eve.  I was so excited to try it and have hope.  Im thankful for all those who are benefiting from it.  Good luck to all.  It just wasnt for me. ",Tirzepatide 
"My doctor recommended Mounjaro,  I objected because of previous experience with side effects from Byetta,  Victoza,  Trulicity.  He said the side effects were mild.  I agreed to try 2. 5,  that was a horrible decision!  My heart rate elevated,  pulse,  blood pressure increased,  couldnt eat,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  loss of sense of balance.  When to doctor 2 days later  I was so dehydrated I required 2 12 bags of IV solution to help me drive home.  I cant remember ever being so sick.  I will never take again or recommend to anyone! ",Tirzepatide 
"I started using Mounjaro at 2. 4 mg,  worked great,  no side effects.  After the doctor increased it to 5 mg,  I developed severe stomach pain,  both upper and lower.  I couldn not tolerate the pain.  I was taking oxycodone.  Tried to live with the pain,  but I couldn not take it anymore,  so I stopped.  Taking this medication,  be very careful with what you are doing.  My blood pressure was very high.  My doctor was out of reach,  so I went to another doctor.  He prescribed a test on my pancreas,  and the test came out bad.  I was informed to stop this medication and take another test in six months.  They didn not tell me what is wrong they just told me to stop this medication and that I have to take another test in 6 months.  It is very serious. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started at 373 pounds type 2 diabetic.  My blood sugar was under control I was taking metformin for about a year.  My A1c was around a 6.  In 2 months time I have lost 65 pounds.  I started with the 2. 5mg,  no side effects,  moved to a 5mg had the suffer burps that folks are eluding too but nothing else.  I went to the 7. 5mg then moved to the 10mg.   From about 5mg on I had to make myself eat and like others I started eating right.  My energy levels are up.  No vomiting or liver failure,  thank God.  I am now currently on the 12. 5mg.  Other than no appetite no I seemed to have dodged the side effects.  I would recommend this to anyone it has done wonders for me. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started Mounjaro 7 weeks ago.  The first shot made me so nauseous and have such bad abdominal pain that lasted for 12 hours I almost went to the ER.  Told my doctor about my experience and she gave me zofran and told me to continue dieting.  Fast forward to this weekend  took my shot on Friday morning then spent all day Saturday and Sunday projectile vomiting it literally ended up about 7 feet from where I was standing,  uncontrollable diarrhea,  disgusting sulfur burps,  horrible heartburn,  and dizziness.  Finally decided to go to the ER and got treated for dehydration.  They told me to follow up with my primary doctor to talk about the best way to continue the medication.  After this experience I am NEVER taking this drug again.  While I have lose 25lbs in the past 7 weeks I believe its mostly because I have been afraid to eat anything.  I will continue to eat healthy and cut carbs and sugars but I won not be taking Mounjaro again. ",Tirzepatide 
"As of today 952022,  I have been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks.   I have experienced upset stomach,  nausea,  weakness,  tiredness.   I am on 2. 5 mg.  Hoping symptoms start to disappear.  I am a Type 2 diabetic,  and the pills didn not seem to help.  I am in my 60s so was wondering if that mattered.  I am not sure.  I would like to continue the Mounjaro,  but if side effects persist,  I may have to try other options. ",Tirzepatide 
"I had previously been on Trulicity,  and the doctor switched me to Mounjaro since I have so much extra weight on me.   He started me on the 5mg pen since I had already been on Trulicity.   I lost minimal weight on Trulicity.   Some,  but not enough to say it is awesome.   The only side effect I have had on Mounjaro is occasional constipationreflux,  which is manageable.  Maybe it is because I got pastthru all the nasty side effects while on Trulicity,  and that minimized the effects of Mounjaro?   I feel bad for all those that have had adverse effects on Moujarno.   I have lost about 10 pounds so far in just over 2 weeks,  and I can tell a HUGE difference in my appetite.  I mean HUGE.   I am not hungry like I used to be.   In fact,  this drug curbs my appetite SO much,  that I have to force myself eat sometimes,  and in having to do that,  it makes me instinctively want to eat more healthy food.  This drug has helped with weight loss,  and I am excited to see how much I will lose and get my A1C down. ",Tirzepatide 
Been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks for weight loss.  Started with 2. 5 the first month now on 5 mg.  Lost 20 lbs so far.   Been on 5 mg for 5 days now and extremely fatigued and weak however Im not going to complain because Im not hungry at all.  Have no desire for food since being on 5 mg.   You have to make yourself eat and drink because you feel full constantly.  Mouth is very dry so drinking water regularly is a must.  Highly recommend for weight loss.  Hopefully the fatigue will go away once Im into the second week of the 5 mg and my body adjusts. ,Tirzepatide 
"In November 2022,  my ACI was 7. 4 and I weighed 258 pounds at 67 years old.  The wake up call was when I renewed my life insurance,  big jump in premium due to the AC1 and weight.  I was now tagged as a Type 2 Diabetic.  I was referred to an Endocrinologist who did extensive blood work.  It was agreed to go on Mounjaro 2. 5 mg.  The first week I suffered some side effects such as nausea,   constipation,  and acid burps.  Within 10 days,  the symptoms subsided due to stool softeners,  lots of fruit berries,  and Nexium.  The first month I dropped 10 pounds with no dieting,  just was not hungry at all.  I had no cravings especially for sweets like cookies,  donuts,  and candy all things that i used to eat.  Fast forward March 2023,  I am down to 217 pounds and 20 more to go.  I am now on Mounjaro 10mg,  it a bit strong,  but the results are fantastic.  My AC1 is now 5. 6 which is fantastic.  The bad news is nothing fits,  all new suits for the spring . ",Tirzepatide 
"I lost over 40 lbs and leveled off at an ideal weight.  Best of all,  my A1c dropped to a non diabetic level.  My ophthalmologist has said there is now no sign of diabetes in my eyes.  I have been able to reduce the meds I was taking.  I am much more active because I weigh so much less and feel better.  I followed the advice in the enclosure for the drug and ate small meals several times a day rather than large meals.  I have not had trouble with side effects.  I hope that the cost is reduced so that more people can afford it.  Its biggest downside is the expense. ",Tirzepatide 
"I just took my fourth infection and I couldnt be more excited !  Ive lost 10 pounds in three weeks ,  my appetite is controlled ,  I feel like Ive finally got some hope to get my health where it needs to be .  My morning fasting glucose is close to 100  always near 140 no more crazy spikes hitting 200 300 .  
I do get very tired day of each shot .  The first three days or so of my first injection I was so ill  sick stomach  I got some zofran and that helped tremendously so Ill expect to need that each dose increase .  Looking very forward to 5 mg next week  ins wont pay for it yet even though Im type 2 ,  but Ive got a coupon for it and paid 25 a month .  Thank God or I couldnt get it ,  hopefully soon it will be covered . ",Tirzepatide 
"I have been on Ozempic 2mg since it came out.  When I couldn not get it due to shortage I was prescribed Mounjaro 5mg.  Five days after eating my one meal a day,  I intermittent fast,  and I started vomiting.  I spent the whole night throwing up every half hour.  I  figured it was a side effect and hoped I would improve.  I had stomach and back pain,  weakness,  and was unable to eat.  I was in bed until I had to get up and sit due to pain,  sleeping off and on.  I could only drink water.  I got worse and finally,  5 days later had my husband drive me to the ER.  I know I should have gone sooner.  I didn not take a second shot. 
I had a CAT scan and was told I had a bowel obstruction and I would be admitted and there for a few days.  If they couldn not resolve through a tube down my nose I would have surgery.  Luckily it was resolved by the nasal tube,  but it was awful. 
My medical care pharmacist told me to try Mounjaro 2. 5mg.  I was worried but did it.  I didn not get nausea but I had all these other side effects.  I quit taking it. ",Tirzepatide 
"Ive been taking Mounjaro now for 4 months.  I was prescribed it to treat my type 2 diabetes as well as for weight loss.  Let me just say this drug has been miracle!  I started out at 268lbs,  5ft 6in male I am now at 225lbs!  Over 40 pounds in 4 months!  Only other weight loss program that helped me like this was the military !  Now let me just say its not all Mounjaro,  Ive changed my eating habits,  and changed what foods Im actually eating and boom working like a dream.  My A1C has also dropped from 7. 5 to 5. 8,  this drug is an amazing stepping stone to a healthier life.  
Only side effects Ive experienced since starting are loss of appetite,  and constipation,  not to bad in my opinion! ",Tirzepatide 
"I had a very bad experience with Mounjaro.   After two weeks of taking the 5. 0 mg,  I developed chest pains and a severe case of what I thought was reflux or heartburn.  I really felt like I might be having a heart attack.  I stopped taking it and reported it to my doctor.   My doctor suggested I should continue taking it,  but she would reduce the dose.   I went back on metformin for about a month then,  I started the 2. 5 mg dose of Mounjaro.   I took the reduced dose for about two weeks and started having severe pains in my upper stomach.   I went to urgent care,  and they examined me and took xrays,  then sent me to the ER for further tests.  After a CT scan,  I was told my gallbladder was inflamed and needed to be taken out.   I was in surgery by 1030 am the next morning to have my gallbladder removed.   I am 60 years old and have never had any problems this severe.  I have fully recovered from the surgery but now have a 1700 hospital bill.  Thank God for insurance.  The total bill was over 50, 000. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started on a 2. 5 mg dose for 30 days and had nothing positive or negative.  The doctor increased it to 12. 5 mg and my appetite went to zero,  stomach pain,  throw up,  diarrhea generally nausea,  and ill feeling,  but did lose 15 lbs in 3 weeks and my blood labs were near perfect.  I was ready to quit until I saw this.  The second month my appetite came back slightly and I learned to eat less and cleaner so it wouldnt make me throw up,  lost another 15 lbs and it excited me to get back in the gym daily.  Since the drug slows your digestion it slows the bowel too which gave me insane constipation and make sure I eat enough fiber daily.  At first,  the side effects are hell but stick with it as they only lasted a month,  then your body adjusts and you learn how to eat and work with it.  The end results are worth it.  Its been 9 months and I have lost 35 lbs,  labs are excellent and for the first time,  I have seen glucose under 100 in 30 years. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am overweight and was sent to an endocrinologist by my PCP.   A1C came back 6. 9 and I received the dreaded diabetes diagnosis.  Endocrinologist asked me about my eating habits and suggested Mounjaro once a week injection.  Sceptical I was,  but I was willing to try with getting my weight down and get my A1C down.   First injection,  no severe vomiting or anything.  The only side effect I had was the constipation,  I was put on a stool softener and take fibre daily which eliminated that side effect.   Within two months I was down 15 pounds,  have not given in to eating a Boston crme doughnuts on which I tend to binge,  limited on my intake of food because over indulging makes me feel lousy and gives me indigestion,  within three months my A1C is down to 5. 3 and my weight is still going down.  Thank you so much to the researchers who created this drug because it has saved my life and gotten me on the road to better health.  The needle doesn not even hurt when I self inject.  I am grateful. ",Tirzepatide 
"I was on 2. 5 dosages for several weeks.  I felt a little nauseous but was losing weight and very happy.   I was not waking up in the middle of the night feeling hungry.  When I went to refill my next prescription,  all the pharmacy had was 12. 5 mg so I agreed to try.   Huge mistake.   I have severe nausea,  felt like I have the flu,  can not stay awake,  and body aches are ridiculous,  I projectile vomited what looks like coffee grounds,  I have awful sulphuric burps,  and cant even keep down sips of water.   Ive missed 2 days of work thus far and have to have someone come to my house tomorrow to give me an iv because Im too scared to drive.   Not worth it at all. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started on 2. 5mg for a month,  then went to 5mg.  All I can say is that I am tired of being sick.  It feels like a stomach bug every time you eat something,  and I am talking about healthy food.  I have had nothing but sickness.  I have not lost any weight,  I am bloated all the time and just plain sick.  It really has not done anything for me,  but I hope this helps. ",Tirzepatide 
"Ive been taking Mounjaro for 5 weeksdoses.  Two days after taking the first dose,  I experienced a very stiff and sore neck.  Five weeks later,  it is just as bad and has migrated to my shoulder and arm. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started this 7 weeks ago and have one more injection.  The first set was at 2. 5 mg from the gynecologist.  Within the first week,  I lost 5 pounds and by week 5 I saw a huge difference!  I went from a 22 waist to a true size 18,   and still shrinking.  I was having trouble catching my breath before I started this.   I had a couple of pains in my stomach,  similar to gas pains like clockwork,  the day after the injection.  But it was bearable.  Sometimes I get a smelly burp issue.  But now I have lost 20 pounds at week 7 and feel amazing.  Please do yourself a favor and take fiber daily,  this medicine will get you constipated. ",Tirzepatide 
"I responded very well going from 0. 5 to 15 over time.  My A1C is now down to normal and my morning fasting blood sugar which is why I started this medication is also normal.  I have lost approximately 34 of original body weight over 13 months.  I did have some gastric side effects intermittently but was able to manage them with no harm.  We will taper off as this year progresses although the medication backorder may interfere with that process as we are looking to do it safely to preserve the diabetes progress Ive made thus far.  We shall see,  but it seems strange that this medication continues to be advertised while there is a shortage.  It also seems strange that in this day and age there is a shortage.  That should not be the case,  especially given the price.  Other than the disruption caused by the shortage,  I am very happy with the results and benefits of this medication.  I highly recommend it. ",Tirzepatide 
I started taking this medication in December of 2022.  I have had no side effects but being a little tired.  My A1C went down significantly from 11. 7 to 5. 6 and I have lost 100 pounds.  My current dose is 12. 5 but I did start on the lowest dose and moved up.  I actually feel so much better! ,Tirzepatide 
Male 70 years old.  Used Mounjaro for about 13 months.  So far  Ease of use.  A caveman could do it.   Graduated from 2. 5   15. 0 mg progressively over that time.   A1c dropped dramatically.   Weight loss 70 pounds so far.   Waist from 46 to 33 inches.   Side effects mild diarrhea occasionally.   Other   Replaced 100 of clothing.    Can see my feet without bending over.    Groceries cost dropped about 25.   A true miracle drug. ,Tirzepatide 
"I started using Mounjaro 1 year ago and I lost 66 pounds so far.  I went from a size 18 to a size 12.  I am back to being a pre diabetic or not really a diabetic at all,  and I am healthier than ever because of this product.  I no longer have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.  Mounjaro saved my life. ",Tirzepatide 
"In the beginning,  I didn not even feel different,  and then I stepped on the scale and was down 15 lbs after week 3.  I noticed my clothes were getting bigger and bigger,  and now I am down 80 lbs and on a 7. 5 dose.  I have had a lifelong journey with uncontrollable appetite issues,  and this medication greatly curbs them.  It did not happen overnight though,  so be patient.  If you eat a lot of cruciferous veggies,  you are going to be extremely gassy.  If you eat too much or eat things that are hard to digest,  it is going to be harder to tolerate this medication.  I have not been under 200 lbs in 20 years,  so this has been a blessing.  My blood sugars are in check,  and I have more energy.  It is at times difficult to navigate what to eat that will not upset your stomach.  Just watch what you eat and figure out what feels good to your tummy.  Your body will do better with it if you do eat some proteins every now and then instead of a lot of carbs. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am taking or was taking Mounjaro and I have taken 2 months' worth of medication,  and I was feeling great.  Had to have a colonoscopy because of my age,  not the medication,  so was told to skip a week before.  I did take my last shot.  It has been 3 weeks,  and I can not get the 5ml or the 7. 5 ml.  It has been over 4 weeks I have been waiting.  I had to have my doctor make another refill,  and I am still waiting.  I have been a full blown diabetic for about a year.  I have been borderline for over 40 years.  I have high blood pressure and cholesterol problems and feel that Mounjaro was helping,  but the on again,  off again is not helping,  and I can not understand the shortage for medically needed purposes when I am over 300 lbs and 5 feet 6 inches.  I have tried numerous weight loss programs and pills,  but Mounjaro is helping me when I can get it.  The biggest benefit is the calming effect my mind has over the worry about food or sugar levels or high blood pressure.  I see a difference with Mounjaro. ",Tirzepatide 
"I have been taking Mounjaro for 13 weeks.  I am currently on the 7. 5mg dose.  This medicine has changed my life!  My A1C went from 12. 9 to 6. 5 in 12 weeks.  My weight dropped 27 lbs and my relationship with food has improved 100.  
SIDE EFFECTS  slight nausea the day after I increased dosage.  Decreased appetite,  occasional need for a laxative to combat constipation. ",Tirzepatide 
"If anything,  I would call Mounjaro a wonder drug.  In Jan 2023,  I weighed just over 300 pounds and my A1C was hovering around 7 with Ozempic and Metformin.  My Dr.  prescribed Mounjaro and within a few weeks,  I started seeing a marked change.  Now,  9 months later,  I have lost 108 pounds and my last A1C was 5. 0.  I have had no noticeable side effects and it couldn not be easier to use.  The only problem has been getting it.  More than once,  I have had to wait a few days for it to come back in stock at the pharmacy.  I am sleeping better,  have more energy and overall,  feeling healthier.  My Dr.  has even reduced the dosages on several of my other medications and may be able to take me off some of them soon. ",Tirzepatide 
"56 year old male here,  5'10.  Started Mounjaro on 102823,  weighing 291 pounds.  Started at 2. 5mg for 4 weeks,  will be on 5. 0mg for another 5 weeks before upping to 7. 5mg.  The only real side effect has been constipation.  I just had my yearly physical yesterday.  Lost 40 pounds in 6. 5 weeks.  Blood work came back amazing.  A1C was finally under 7. 0.  Discontinuing metformin,  reducing Lipitor.  Mounjaro is life saving. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started medication in early March.  One dose weekly for 6 weeks,  till I quit.  Severe nausea that would last for 5 days after each shot.  It does eliminate your desire to eat,  but I gained 11 pounds during the 6 week period.  Also,  I now have irregular heart beat and shortness of breath from this.  I have been off the medication since mid April.  It is now 6923,  and I am still having problems,  and upcoming heart tests scheduled. ",Tirzepatide 
"3. 5 months from 2. 5mg to 5. 0mg.  Even before starting 7. 5mg my experience has been positive.  Less stressful as if my cortisol levels are low.  No desire to drink alcoholic beverages.  

Appetite suppressed loss of inches before any noticeable weight loss.  Slow loss of excess weight.  PCOS symptoms have mostly disappeared,  however when refills were not available,  all symptoms almost immediately presented again,  including desire to snack.  Constipation is noticeable at 5. 0mg

Starting 7. 5mg now.  22lb of excess weight lost after 3. 5mo of use. ",Tirzepatide 
"My use of Mounjaro has been very positive.  My blood sugars are stable and I am down 60 pounds.  Side effects for me thus far are slight reflux if I eat too late and my taste isn not as pronounced.  But,  I feel so much better. . .  more energy and joint pain has pretty much disappeared.  Best part of all?  I am NOT HUNGRY!  I was born hungry!  Also,  for me,  the shots have been painless.  A few more pounds to go,  then I will be on a maintenance dose.  I am assuming I can take this medication long term.  Hooray for Mounjaro! ",Tirzepatide 
"I started on the 2. 5 dose in October,  my doctor felt that the weight loss would help with my joint pain and lower my A1C.  From day 1 I was extremely nauseous,  had no desire to eat,  had sulfur burps,  and had constipation.  I spoke with my doctor,  who encouraged me to ride it out.  On week four I was stepped up to the 5 mg dosage.  The doctor called in Zofran for stomach issues.  On week six I called her and said I could no longer function.  During this time I was so fatigued and was having heart palpitations and was barely able to walk 20 feet without being totally exhausted.  I chalked it up to being so nauseous and not eating.  Then my legs started to burn like I had walked up a steep hill,  and felt so sore and bruised I could barely sit.  That week I had my follow up appointment with my doctor.  I told her about my symptoms,  and she said that rhabdomyolysis is not a side effect of Mounjaro.  I was never dehydrated,  but my CK levels were still 440 two weeks off the medication!  8 weeks later,  and no improvement! ",Tirzepatide 
"I was put on Mounjaro 4 weeks ago for type 2 diabetes and the 3rd week the once a week injection pen didn not work.  The internal mechanics seized up and I didn not get any medicine.  I called Mounjaro support and spoke with Belinda and went through a series of questions and gave her my pharmacy information,  was on hold and also speaking with Belinda for over one hour and 15 minutes it is 3 days later and my pharmacy still did not receive a call for a replacement from Belinda.  This is a horrible product and even worse customer service. ",Tirzepatide 
"Mounjaro works!  My blood sugar was off the charts.  The first week I started taking Mounjaro,  my blood sugar was within normal limits.  I dont remember the last time it was normal.  Very little side effects the first week.  No side effects second week to date.  Taking my 8th does tonight.  And lost 7 pounds. ",Tirzepatide 
I started out on the 2. 5 for 2 months and lost 15 lbs and my A1C dropped from 6. 7 to 6. 0.   Mild side effect symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea.   I started the 5mg and had explosive diarrhea and uncontrollable vomiting with abdominal  back pain.  My blood pressure dropped to 8855.   I had to stop taking the Mounjaro.   After 3 weeks I am starting to feel normal again.   Sorry it didnt work for me.   It did curb the appetite. ,Tirzepatide 
"My doctor put me on Mournjaro for potential type 2 diabetes.  Just after one month of taking it,  I have been through living starting into the 3rd week of taking 2. 5g. . .  for the past 2 weeks,  dizziness,  severe shaking and trembling,   my throat swelling so much that I am having trouble swallowing and having a sip of water.   I have stopped taking it,  and cannot wait for this mess to get out of my system and be normal again. .  I did not have any of these issues prior.   I did loose 12 lbs,  buts it is def not worth choking. ",Tirzepatide 
"I tried to leave a review but for some reason wasn not posted,  so I will try again. 

My doctor took me off of Mounjaro recently.  I developed large welts about 24 hours after I injected the 75 doses and 10.  

My doctor fears I am developing an allergic reaction,  so I am going back to the rival insulin alternative.  I had more side effects with the Ozempic,  exhaustion,  extreme nausea,  and constipation,  but hopefully,  over time they go away this time.  Too bad,  because I really wanted to stay on Mounjaro. 

It should be noted that I really like the Mounjaro very much.  Well controlled sugar,  once I was on my maintenance dose of 10.  

For some reason,  I gained five pounds while on Mounjaro,  I never lost weight.  Where I lost about 15 pounds on the other mentioned insulin alternative.  It seems that other patients on other review sites have this welt issue too.  The issue should be reported not only to the doctor but per the request of the manufacturer,  please report to them as well. ",Tirzepatide 
"Im struggling to get below 154 lbs and being 5 thats a lot of weight to carry which induces back pain.  Lost 20 lbs on Ozempic from the beginning of the year till June,  have managed to gain back 5lb which isnt awful but still not at my goal weight.  I just left the ER from getting a bolus of saline due to dehydration.  Im battling hypoglycemia.  I took my first shot on Tuesday,  Wednesday felt decent but malaise was setting in,  Thursday,  didnt even realize I had not eaten all day and all night at work.  Friday night,  tried to eat half of a sandwich  was completely nauseous.   Tonight  work after eating half a sandwich  a few green beans I had terrible diarrhea  became so dizzy  nauseated I was forced to leave work having someone else take over my patients.  Just a word of advice,  if youre a busy person,  this med may not be for you.  I had side effects of fever,  chills,  nausea,  diarrhea,  fatigue,  muscle pain and I was negative for flu, Covid and strep.  Dr said go back to Ozempic  but Ive lost 6 lbs already! ",Tirzepatide 
"I was using Ozempic but Dr switched to Mounjaro,   it has been terrible!    I lost a lot of weight on Ozempic but gained some back since being in Mounjaro also my blood sugar rose 10 15 points since switching !   I have had numerous side effects mainly headaches and constipation.   When giving it it always seems to leak back out of my skin and I have tried stomach,  arms thighs all the same!   I am not happy",Tirzepatide 
"Great.  After one shot I lost a little weight and my  sugar monitor finally went under 100.  Spikes of 127 to 145 in the morning stopped.  By my third shot my glucose readings were averaging high 80s!  And lost 15 pounds.  
Still watching my diet,  no sugar, low  carbs ",Tirzepatide 
"Rx for weightloss,  extreme fatigue for the first 3 days after injection I stayed in bed.  I thought it was good for controlling binge eating.  However,  I eventually started to get so dizzy after standing up that I had to hold the counters and walls to get around for the first few minutes after standing.  I also started to notice a thickness or knot in my throat after the first 2 months.  I had to stop taking because no amount of weight loss is worse than being a cancer patient or bed bound.  The weight loss was extremely slow for me too.  I went from being on no meds to relying daily on heartburn medicine,  miralax,  Tylenol  ginger chews for nausea.  And the price was ridiculous.  I would have rather bought some cosmetic surgery.  I was on it 5 months.  2. 5,  then 0. 5,  finally 7. 5mg. ",Tirzepatide 
Was using it for my diabetes and the price went up on Medicare.  Mounjaro changed my life for the better.  Now cannot take it because of the cost.  PROFIT is all that matters to you.  Cost of producing it is not even close to the price you want to sell it to the public.  Give us a break! ! ,Tirzepatide 
"In the past year,  I have lost 54 lbs.  My A1C is at 6. 7 from 9. 9.  My insulin use has dropped to 20 units a day.  Blood pressure has dropped as well! ! !  At this time,  I feel like Mounjaro is saving my life. ",Tirzepatide 
"No side effects.  Started 12 weeks ago.  No problems.  I have been on a very strict diet for 16 weeks.  Now on the medicine Mounjaro.  I am not hungry,  so it is pretty helpful for my diet.  Hopefully,  by November,  my weight loss will be noticeable.  I have lost 16 lbs so far.  I walk and stay very active,  but I am going to increase my exercise.  I don not want to lose muscle mass and I need to keep my strength and skin healthy and tight.  I am 62 years young.  I have type two diabetes I got afterwards from Covid,  as many have.  I am hoping the Mounjaro continues to work on my A1C.  It looks like it has been so far.  I will not be staying on this drug,  I promised myself 8 months max,  so pray for me and send good karma.  Also,  my doctor finds my low calorie diet fine with the food I am eating. ",Tirzepatide 
"My husband suffered from severe nausea mostly at night,  but also from loss of appetite,  constipation,  and increased fatigue.   He could not even get out of bed after one injection.   He will not take a second dose. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started with 2 12 went up to five and then now I am at 10.  I lost a few pounds a week although my appetite is much less than usual.  The side effects have been very minimal mostly headache,  sore throat hoarseness seems to linger never really goes constipation.  Can be an issue at times that only for myself,  but other people I know on the same drug.   My PA is working very closely with her and paying attention to absolutely everything closely.  I feel that its a safe drug so far if you have a doctor or PA that is on board with you and to a full degree of attention. 
My hope is that once my A1c is an order that I will be able to discontinue the drug completely although some studies,  recommend that not to be probable again,  working close with my doctor and care team.  Thank you for your time. ",Tirzepatide 
I like this drug!  I just can not get what strength I need to take it as prescribed.  I hate that I have to be without it for sometimes 10 days or more!  I think it should be a priority for people who need it for diabetes versus weight loss. ,Tirzepatide 
"I am only on my second week,  but I have lost 7 pounds so far.  It forces me to eat because if I don not,  I feel sick,  but when I eat,  I get full super fast. . .  So it is like it is forcing me to do good and not starve myself.  I really like that.  The first week I had slight nausea here and there and a couple of headaches.  Also a little indigestion.  I do feel pretty tired.  I have been eating a low carb diet.  I am going to incorporate exercise at the end of this week.  I can only imagine how much I have the potential to lose once I start exercising,  if I have lost 7 just by eating better.  Over all I am satisfied with this drug.  I am on the low dose right now. ",Tirzepatide 
"I did have many side effects to this medication at first.  However,  more recently,  I have been experiencing fewer side effects.  My A1C before taking Mounjaro was above a 10,  and now my A1C is 6. 3.  I have lost 40 lbs and have a satisfied feeling after eating a small amount of food.  My side effects at the beginning were rough nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  indigestion,  stomach pain by my liver and pancreas,  excess gasbloating,  hypoglycemia,  and sour stomach.  I know that this is a bit of a list,  however,  I feel that it is worth it in the end.  I work in a hospital and have seen the outcome of having long term effects of diabetes it is not pretty.  So,  if I have to suffer a little bit to try and prevent long term effects,  then I will.  The main effects that I have now,  after about a year or more of treatment,  are diarrhea,  sour stomach,  and some gasbloating.  I am currently on the 7. 5mg once a week and have been good on this strength for a while. ",Tirzepatide 
"My dose at 2. 5mg was tolerable.  Minimal side effects.  5mg more side effects with nausea,  sour stomach,  gas.  7. 5mg has been a disaster.  Heartburn.  Headaches,  lethargy,  tiredness,  no appetite and need to force food on myself.  Low blood sugar on CGM libre2.  I can not eat enough to get myself back to 90.  I keep pegging 70 because I can not eat and am sick to my stomach all the time.  My sleep is interrupted,  and I must lie down constantly.  I feel like I want to sleep all the time.  Weight has dropped from 250 to 233 lbs,  but if I can not get out of bed,  what is the point?  I will talk to my doc about going back to 2. 5mg for the A1C control but this drug needs work. ",Tirzepatide 
"The meds did exactly what I expected.  Lowered A1C and I lost weight.   
The bad part is I was so sick on days 3 5 that it was awful.  I couldnt do my usual activities.   No swimming for fear of losing control of bowels,  and severe nausea.  It worked great but the side effects were extremely uncomfortable,  lost sleep from GERD.   Disappointing for me. ",Tirzepatide 
"Happy Holidays Everyone,  this medication is making it impossible for me to do anything.  Dr prescribed it   Day 1 felt fine,  Day 2 near the end of the day had no desire for food   nothing.  Today is Day 3 and Ive been nauseous all day and near the end of the day started to get diarrhea.  The nausea has been pretty bad though I did work out it made it worse and had to skip some of it.  Also,  today because of nausea,  I have not wanted anything to eat.  I forced myself to have half of an English muffin with peanut butter and then this evening a Campbell is soup to go since I was feeling so sick.  I will not be taking the second dose this coming week when it is due because I feel miserable.  It has a 5 day half life which is why I didnt want to take it to begin with in case of side effects.  It seems a lot of people get these side effects and what Ive learned is I always seem to get the side effects of medication.  Be cautious.  It needs a reversal pronto! ",Tirzepatide 
"Doing very well.  No side effects.  I am 10 weeks in on the med.  My diabetes numbers are still a lot higher than I thought they would be,  but they have come down a little bit.  I have been on an extreme diet trying to only consume vegetables,  a little fruit,  and mostly fish and chicken   very low calories.  I have taken out everything white.  Almost 0 carbs to help get and keep my numbers down.  I do have yellow in the toilet I never saw before,  around the stool   yellow color in the water around the poop. ",Tirzepatide 
"I have been on Mounjaro for almost 3 months.  So far,  I have had no negative side effects and I am currently on a 7. 5 mg dosage.  My blood sugars are averaging 150,  which is better than I have experienced in my more than 30 years as a type 2 diabetic.  Also,  I have lost about 12 pounds in that time,  which is fine,  but I really don not need to lose more.  I have reduced my long acting insulin to about 13 of my previous dosage.  What is amazing to me is that I can eat a meal and without fast acting insulin,  my blood sugars go down!  I guess the Mounjaro somehow senses that blood sugar is starting to rise and signals the pancreas to secrete more insulin.  So far,  I am more than happy with Mounjaro. ",Tirzepatide 
"Tracked daily side effects weekly for several weeks.  Had the injection on Sunday.  The cycle was repeated each week.   If taken in the morning,  I was unable to sleep that night.  Changed to 2 hours before bed and slept but woke up feeling exhausted.  Developed headachemigraine and mind fog by mid morning with neck pain and stiffness.  Fatigue,  neck pain,  mind fog,  and migraine came in waves and lasted until late Wednesday.  I began to feel better by Thursday and back to normal by Friday.  Only small impact on blood sugar numbers.  Frequently hungry and craved carbs.  No weight loss. ",Tirzepatide 
"My doctor recommended Mounjaro to me.  I was nervous about it because I wasn not sure if I could give myself a shot.  I understand all of the possible side effects.  I didn not have any side effects whatsoever.  I started taking it when I was around 288.  I am now down to 188 and I feel amazing!  When I was heavier,  I was on three different types of blood pressure medication.  I am down to just one blood pressure medication.  Not only did it help me with my A1C,  it also helped with my blood pressure and it helped me quit smoking as well! ",Tirzepatide 
"I am starting week three.   As others have stated,  it changed my RELATIONSHIP with food.   I no longer focus or have cravings for salty and sweet,  carbs,  beginning day 3.  No urge for late night snacking.   I cant eat carbs like potatoes,  or bread,  or I get a stomach ache.  A big improvement  I was so fatigued before,  I could barely make it through the day and now I have the energy,  to go into the pool and do some gentle exercising.  I just dont get hungry.   I was able to drop pop completely for water.   I dont know what is in this medicine,  but it really has made a profound impact on my life.   Ive lost 6 pounds so far,  but it feels like Ive lost a couple of inches in my clothes.   Highly recommend. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started August 28 with 2. 5 mg and worked up to 12. 0 mg.   Starting weight was 291. 5 and now at 252. 5 with the holidays behind me.   I haven not experienced any serious negative side effects at any dose,  but I think part of the reason has been continuing with a low carb high protein diet.   The biggest positive was reducing my appetite,  which has been a tremendous help with controlling what I eat.   I actually look forward to taking it each week! ",Tirzepatide 
"A little bit of back story for the full benefit of transparencyI am a type 2 diabetic on an insulin pump taking 2 Synjardy every morning in addition to my once a week injection.  I was completely insulin resistant.  Since starting the mounjaro in September 2022 on the lowest dose,  I have worked my way up to 10mg.  Now supply shortage kept me from getting my one month supply twice in the last 7 months.  When starting again it did give me nausea and headaches,  my doctor prescribed Zofran and I took ibuprofen.  When I started I weighed 330 pounds and am currently down to 289 as of yesterday.  The biggest benefit to me is that my pump has had to work less because the mounjaro keeps my blood sugar steady at about 90.  I am hoping as I continue to lose weight I need less and less insulin,  that is the doctor is goal.  So while yes there are side effects initially they did not hang around for me and if you can push through them,  they do subside.  I am 48 years old and have been diabetic since I was 23. ",Tirzepatide 
"My post wont be as exciting to everyone because I am not going to discuss the weight loss.   I will however,  boast how it has been very effective for controlling my blood sugars.   I was struggling with highs no matter what was happening and finally got control when on Ozempic.  But,  the shortage happened and my numbers started to climb again.  Now on Mounjaro and praying you keep your word and make certain that us diabetics can get it.  My numbers are looking good again.   An eye Dr visit yesterday scared me because he said I have retinal bleeds that occur when blood sugars are too high.   Diabetics need this medication and while I understand weight loss is important losing my eyesight because my blood sugars are out of control is vital.   I pray that I am able to keep on this medication because for me its my health.   For weight,  I can walk and eat better.   I am on 12. 5mg and no side effects to complain about. ",Tirzepatide 
"My A1c is now 5. 1!  My hunger,  which used to be constant and persistent,  is no longer an issue.  I feel full and don not have cravings for food.  I am admittedly a 'foodie' and used food for all situations,  whether good or bad.  In addition to controlling my diabetes and improving my A1c,  Mounjaro 5mg is helping me better manage my hunger and caloric intake.  I have lost 60 pounds,  which has significantly improved my diabetes.  I have gone from morbidly obese to obese on the BMI scale,  and I feel confident that I can achieve my goal to finally reach a healthy weight with Mounjaro and my new lifestyle of healthy eating.  I haven not experienced any significant negative side effects other than some indigestion,  but I had reflux before,  so I can not say that Mounjaro is at fault solely.  The injections aren not painful and are very easy to self administer.  The once a week schedule is convenient,  so managing my type 2 diabetes is a huge success with Mounjaro so far! ",Tirzepatide 
"Started on 2. 5 mg on 8132023.  Today is 1192023.  67 year old male,  am 6'0' tall and started at 258.  This morning,  I weighed in at 236,  a loss of 22 in 10 weeks.  My sugar was running in the 175 195 range regularly,  it is now down in the 110 130 range.  I am still on 2. 5 mg,  and will have my first follow up at 4 months,  or next month.  My last blood work was the best in years.  Cholesterol,  triglycerides all came back much better.  I will say that I did a little research and it was recommended not to be prescribed for heavy alcohol users.  I used to have a large cocktail every night after work,  and a couple on the weekends.  I stopped,  and now have 2 3 beers a week.  My only real side effects are a lack of desire to snack much anymore,  and some heartburn the first couple of days after the weekly injection.  I will use this as long as they let me. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started Mounjaro due to negative diabetic blood  other chemistry results  did not want to use,  restart any diabetic medications due to allergic type results with them.  I am also an emotional,  indiscriminate eater.  I was 77 years old  extremely sedentary.  BP 12088,  213 pounds.  When I started in February of 2022 at beginners dose for three months when Blood Results were first taken,  A1c was at 7. 5 blood sugar,  100.  BP,  other blood results were all within acceptable limits  that time,  even though on a negative high end.  With the start of the first injection,  I noticed a fullness in my  istomach' that did not allow me try to stuff myself.  Not only did it not allow me to overeat or shove the food in my mouth,  I lost that desire.  Food did not become the first  foremost thought in my head.  What I thought about was how to manage eating.  I started seriously fasting nothing after 5 6 pm except water or unsweetened ice tea,  breaking fast around 5 6 am.  Currently on 5 mg,  A1c 6. ",Tirzepatide 
I take this medication for my type 2 diabetes but after 4 months it has not helped lower my blood sugar.   I have lost 25 lbs but the cost is too high.   It causes an extremely upset stomach for four days but I feel better in time to take another shot.   I am currently on 10 mg but considering not taking it anymore. ,Tirzepatide 
"Great if you can get it!  I went on Mounjaro 7. 5 eight weeks ago.  My A1C had been 9. 9 and my daily numbers in the 180s.  Trulicity was not working for me.  I am 62 and my height is 5'6'',  weight 190.  Immediately,  my numbers started coming down.  Was 90 yesterday and has not gone over 115.  You immediately get a sensation of not being full.  Have not had A1C yet but that is another four weeks away.  I have lost 8 pounds,  but that is not really my pressing concern.  I was very skinny throughout my childhood and made bad food choices later in life.  What does concern me is that all pharmacies are out of it with no word on when it is coming back in.  This is very concerning to me and Lily has gone into radio silence.  Big thing on Oprah about it last night which will now make this even harder to get.  Very,  very disappointing. ",Tirzepatide 
"What a game changer this medicine is for weight loss. . . unfortunately at 500month after coupon it is just cost prohibitive.   The first month my insurance did cover,  and what I noticed were immediate impacts on appetite,  no urge to snack,  no anxiety eating,  and no hunger pangs.   I have about 60 pounds to lose,  and lost 5. 5 pounds that first month.    I did not have any side effects,  except once I ate something sweet I had a little nausea.   Lesson  don not eat sweets   I really wish my insurance would cover this,  because I have never experienced anything like it. ",Tirzepatide 
"I didnt think anything could decrease my appetite,  but boy did this!   Completely lost it so much so that,  for 2 days,  my blood sugar levels were not high enough to give any injections of my regular insulin or my long acting one.  Then I started to have diarrhea.  Its not fun!   But if youre looking for something to quash your appetite,  this is it! ",Tirzepatide 
"Dosage 2. 5mg.  First week had stomach problems for 2 days. 
Second week have stomach issues severe gas pains.   This is day four.  It is getting somewhat better.   Needless to say I am not going to continue on this medication.   In nine days I lost one pound woop! ",Tirzepatide 
"I just finished my first month of Mounjaro 2. 5mg.   I did experience some side effects on the first day nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea but the second day was better.  After eating a small meal I experienced bad sulfur like burps throughout the day.  So I took Pepto Bismol and that worked like a charm! !  So before each one of my injections,  I take a dose of it the first half hour before with no problems now. ",Tirzepatide 
"Started on 2. 5 in August because I was looking for one medication to lower A1C.  Currently on Metformin and Jardiance.  By November,  A1C dropped from 6. 9 to 5. 8.  Changing diet also helped lower cholesterol.  I titrated up to 5 mg,  but since then I have gone back to 2. 5 due to not wanting to lose any more weight.  I lost a total of 30 pounds and have been maintaining my weight for the past 30 days,  which I am comfortable with.  I worked out 3 5 days a week during this time and did intermittent fasting.  Even with working out,  I noticed muscle and strength loss,  so I am now doing more strength training to build back up.  Currently,  2. 5 mg does not suppress my appetite,  but it continues to help me with glucose levels.  I wear a CGM.  I hope to keep the weight off with the tools I have learned in the past six months.  I experienced minimal side effects on both doses,  occasionally slight headache and constipation.  My goal is to eliminate all other medications and stay on this low dose as my only medication for diabetes. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am currently on 7. 5 injection and being on the medication for about 4 months,  my A1C has gone down.  I do experience a little headache and nausea after every injection but that goes away after a day.  I am really happy with this medication and I hope my A1C continues to improve as time goes by. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am 72 years old and I started on Mounjaro 9 weeks ago.  I started first 4 weeks at 2. 5mg,  then next 4 weeks at 5. 0mg.   My doctor has now prescribed 7. 5 mg for the next 4 weeks.   I started on the 7. 5 mg today.   I feel very good on this medication and I have had no side effects.  My starting weight was 186 pounds.   I am 5'8 so this was more weight that I should not be carrying around.   As of this writing I weigh 177. 5 pounds.   
My beginning A1C was 9. 0,  it is down to 6. 9 and keeps very stable during the day.   I do not feel hungry or crave anything.   I feel very good and I am amazed that this medication works so well for me.   I have had diabetes for more than 10 years and this is the first time that my blood glucose readings have been so much better than ever before. ",Tirzepatide 
"My a1c went from 7. 4 on insulin to 6. 1 on just Mounjaro.  I have used it for almost a year now.  Nausea the day after I take the injection is bad sometimes,  but mostly I tolerate it well.  I lost 22 lbs on it alone and went off it recently because of the cost of Medicare.  It is a great drug and has worked well for me.  I am 75 and still working full time.  I lost a total of 42 lbs but need to lose more. ",Tirzepatide 
"Began taking Mounjaro at the end of May.  I weighed 179,  A1c was 7. 3.  Blood sugar in the 150s,  not good about testing.  Currently,  my weight is 137. 8   going to the endocrinologist soon.  Blood sugar fasting at 85 today.  No gastrointestinal side effects.  I do get a little itchy at the injection site around the 3rd day,  but it goes away.  My sugar cravings decreased and my appetite decreased within 3 days.  I didn not start out trying to lose weight,  but I became motivated.  I expect to be at my goal weight of 135 by my doctor is appointment and I plan to try to get to my recommended weight of 112. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started on Mounjaro on Nov.  28th.  As far as side effects,  a mild headache the day of injection and the next day,  but went away the third day.  I have taken my second injection on 125 and so far,  as of 127,  no side effects.  Weight loss is 6 lbs so far,  and I am super excited to finally use a medication that doesn not give me severe stomach issues and that lowers my blood sugar.  I noticed the first week of injection my numbers going down,  and now the second week they are normal.  I haven not seen normal in about a year or close to normal.  I have been a diabetic since 2011.  Also,  I have completely changed my diet and am doing a low carb lifestyle with plenty of protein and fiber.  I still have a ways to go,  but I am very optimistic. ",Tirzepatide 
"Its really helping with A1C which is in the normal range.  My side effects are vomiting and heartburn and I am losing weight.  Im now on the 12. 5 mg.  The key is to listen to your body.  It tells me when Im full and I stop eating.  That way you wont be vomiting too much.  It takes a while to figure it out.  For me,  the side effects arent worth stopping the shot. ",Tirzepatide 
"I am a 66 year old female and I started on Mounjaro on November 28,  2022.  My A1C was 9,  and in 3 months,  it went down to 6.  My glucose levels reduced from 196 to 99,  triglycerides from 242 to 159,  and LDL from 203 to 165.  Additionally,  I have lost a total of 72 pounds as of July 17,  2023.  I would definitely recommend Mounjaro. ",Tirzepatide 
"My A1c fell from 7. 2 to 5. 4!  I also lost 20 pounds.  Yes,  my appetite has decreased.  Yes,  I have nausea if I eat too many carbs,  but this helps me keep my numbers in check.  On the downside,  I have an increased bout of constipation which has been somewhat hard to cope with at times.  All in all,  I am very pleased with this medication and will continue using it.

"Welts at Mounjaro  injection sites.  My doctor wants me to to stop and go back on Ozempic. 

i am taking Mounjaro 10 for Type 2 diabetes. 
It was working pretty well for last couple months until I started on the 75 dose.  Loved the low side effects and great glucose control. 

Unfortunately,  Im starting to have a reaction about 20 24 hours after I inject. 

I now have about a 6 welt every time I inject.  Feels like an awful spider bite and is a bit painful. 

Doc concerned I may have a severe reaction,  so unfortunately shes taking me off the medication. 

I did report to manufacturer.  I encourage others to do the same if you have these injection welts. 

Many others  reviews were having a similar issue.  Too bad.  LOVE the medication. ",Tirzepatide 
"Helped get my sugar and weight under control right away.  Did have a lot of nausea,  diarrhea,  and burning sensation on the right side of stomach and back.  I have used all of the dosages for this medication for almost a year. ",Tirzepatide 
"I just started using Mounjaro 2. 5 mg this morning.  I hope to be able to update this post as I go in order to help others know what to expect. 

The injection was a bit painful,  felt much like a bee sting.  I can not poke myself,  so one of my children pressed and held the button for me.  I looked up several videos to know how to give the injection,  which is quite easy. 

I am taking Mounjaro to lower my blood sugar.  I took it while fasting,  as I have read that is recommended.  It is been two hours and my blood sugar has dropped 60 points.  I am going to wait another hour to see if my blood sugar continues to drop.  So far,  no side effects.  I have read that the foods eaten are the reason people get nauseated and have other GI symptoms.  The best guide I have found says to eat protein lean,  fruit no skin,  and cooked vegetables.  Foods to avoid are greasy,  high fat,  and sweets. 

I will update this,  if allowed,  as I experience changes,  including side effects,  blood sugar changes,  and weight loss. ",Tirzepatide 
"It is easy to use however the side effects are horrible.   I have had all of the listed side effects.  Constipation and nausea and vomiting are the worst.  It feels like a rock in my gut however,  it is a little better than ozempic which I puked every day.   so I am sticking with the Mounjaro for now. ",Tirzepatide 
"I began Mounjaro to assist in my diabetic control.  I began on a very low dose,  and then went to 5 mg and then to 7. 5 mg and now 10 mg.  Since beginning the Mounjaro,  my insulin use has drastically decreased.  In fact,  since being on the 10 mg dose,  my use of long acting insulin has gone from 30 units twice daily,  down to 6 units or 0.  My fast acting insulin use was formerly up to 20 units three times a day before a meal,  and now is maybe 6 units during an entire day,  and sometimes none.  I have had a 25 pound weight loss over the last year,  and decreased appetite,  which is certainly a bonus.  I also walk 3 4 miles every morning,  so I am not certain how much weight loss is attributable to exercise,  and how much is the Mounjaro,  but I suspect a combination of both.  I have had no side effects from this medication thus far. ",Tirzepatide 
"I have been on Mounjaro to help loss weight for 8 weeks,  4 at 2. 5mg  4 at 5mg and have not lost weight,  no appetite suppression at all.  I can not tell I am taking anything at all other than burping,  acid reflux and stomach pain through the night after eating. ",Tirzepatide 
"I was prescribed this medication after having an ESG procedure to help with weight loss and in hopes to reverse Type 2.   I also have PCOS and a family history of Type 2.   After being on this medication I am down at least 10 lbs dont remember my weight when I started and my blood glucose is not in diabetic range.   My A1C was 5. 9,  down from 7. 9 and I expect that to be lower on my next labs.   I do have some side effects the most prominent is constipation.   Miralax helps.   I used to get a headache after injection but I take ibuprofen before hand and that helps.   I also inject my thigh,  not my stomach and I do it before bed.   I have to remember to eat and drink water.   I would recommend this medication.   I hope Ive lost enough weight to get off and stay off.   So far so good. ",Tirzepatide 
"I started ozempic 9 months ago.  At the time I was a little over 200 lbs and was taking 1000 mg of metformin daily.  Metformin had worked for me for almost 20 yrs so I didn not expect that is had suddenly stopped working.  For 3 years I gained weight even though I worked out,  and I thought it was just my appetite out of control.  One random day I realized my metformin was the problem.  I saw a new dr who prescribed ozempic.  What a miracle!  9 months later and Im down 40 lbs,  my a1c dropped from 8. 1 to 5. 6,  and I have virtually no symptoms from the drug other than fullness.  The symptoms in the beginning did not last long either.  Nausea,  headache,  fatigue. . . all cleared up within a week or 2 each time my dose was increased.  It can cause what feels like constipation but for me its just that I simply havent eaten enough.  This drug feels too good to be true.  Im so pleased with my experience so far! ",Ozempic
"I did one injection and have been ill since. 
Have had acid reflux,  burping,  vomiting,  constipation,  headache and dizziness.  I tried to eat small meals and drink plenty of water as directed by my physician,  but I have been unable to hold anything down.  5 days after my first injection,  I am off work drinking pedialyte trying to get my strength back and avoid being hospitalized.  This is the worst that I have ever felt in my life. ",Ozempic
"Ive been Ozempic for 4 weeks.   I am so glad that my doctor sat me down and told me what to expect.   She also asked if I could handle it.   She said that if you can make it through the 4th week I promise it will get better.    She was right.   I was pretty sick the first two weeks.   I learned that it had a lot to do with me trying to eat my normal intake of food.   Once I started to catch a clue and making my portions smaller,  I learned it would make me feel better.   I could guarantee if I ate too much,  Id feel like crap.   People arent kidding about the side effects.    Its real.   But I made it and am now starting to feel better with each day.   Ive lost 18 pounds now and Im amazed.    Yes it makes you sick but if you keep trying to eat like you did it will be worse.   You have to start listening to your body    You cant keep eating your same amounts and expect to lose weight. ",Ozempic
"Started on Ozempic Sept 2020,  starting weight 312 lbs 5 4.   I am type 2 diabetic and take 2550mg of Metformin daily.  HbA1c was 79,  sugar cravings and blood sugar out of control.  Started on 0. 25 dose,  for a month.  Quite bad stomach cramps and nausea for the first month.  Went up to 0. 5 on month 2,  then 1. 0 dose for month 3 and since.  No 1 tip   inject into your leg rather than around your belly.  Once I changed to injecting in my leg,  nausea and cramps disappeared overnight  never came back.  To maximise effectiveness,  you cant eat like you did before.  I re joined Weight Watchers in Sept.  I have lost 80lbs in 5 months,  HBA1c dropped from 79 to 51 which is normal type 2 level although the doc feels with more weight loss,  it could go to normal levels.  In Ireland,  diabetes is classed as a long term illness so all medications are covered by the government so I dont have to pay for this.  Otherwise costs 195. ",Ozempic
I took one Ozempic injection at . 25 and ended up at ER 2 days later.  I had horrible bloating.  Burping smelled like eggs.  Unstoppable vomiting and diarrhea.  I ONLY TOOK ONE INJECTION and stopped the medicine.  It has been 2 weeks and the medicine still making me sick.  I am just wondering how long it takes to fully leave your system?  I just want to feel human again.  I was tested for pancreatitis but was ok but dr said will repeat labs soon.  I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION TO ANYONE.  PLEASE BE SAFE TAKING THIS MEDICATION. ,Ozempic
"Ozempic has caused me so much constipation ! ! !  I know a side effect is diarrhea but it does the complete OPPOSITE for me .  A day or two after I take my injection I have no bowel movements at all ! !  Every week I  am forced to take a laxative .  It has caused so many problems for me .  
Anyone else experienced severe constipation .  So frustrated",Ozempic
"I am a 54 year old female who is a1c was 8. 3 at the end of March.   So after 4 months on Ozempic,  my a1c is now 6. 3!  and I have lost 34 lbs.  Definitely curbs my appetite and I have been logging my food.   My side effects have been minimal,  a little nausea in the beginning and constipation.  This med has been a game changer for me.  My hope I that many others will have the same results I have. ",Ozempic
"I was terrified to take this after reading some of the reviews online,  but I have to say I am so happy I started this drug.  I have followed others suggestions about injecting the drug into my upper thigh and not my abdomen.  I was on a . 25 dose for 4 weeks then moved to . 5 and that is what I currently take.  My appetite has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY.  I was addicted to eating junk foods,  and I simply cannot eat them anymore,  my stomach cannot handle them.  I get full after eating one proper sized meal,  and it keeps me going for most of the day,  only having a snack like 1 apple in the evening.  Side effects were mild for me,  had some constipation but I started taking fiber supplements to help with that.  I have been on the medication for 7 weeks now and I am down 10lbs and I feel great.  Make sure your doctor gets you to increase the dose slowly,  inject into your thigh and be ready to make 
better dietary choices when starting this drug.  I truly believe it saved me from morbid obesity. ",Ozempic
"After reading this,  that junk in the fridge will go in the garbage.  
Do NOT  put yourselves through this for weight loss and even diabetes. 
I mean seriously,  which is worse? 
Pancreatitis?  Thyroid cancer?  Horrible gastro conditions?  
Injecting ourselves with this lizard juice can not be good for us. 
And,  its beyond expensive to say the least. 
Pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed of themselves but thats nothing new.  
This is totally off the charts. 
Just say no to drugs these drugs.

"I started Ozempic in late December at . 25 injection.  I also take 500mg metformin per day.  Soon after I started Ozempic I had decreased apetitite and my sugars improved,  but I had reflux,  gas,  bloating,  nausea and diarrhea.  After 4 weeks I started . 50.  2 weeks in I have bouts of painful constipation then diarrhea,  nausea,  bloating,  gas,  reflux and cramping.  I have almost vomited a few times.  When I eat it feels like the food just sits and sits,  barely moving through my gut.  My doctor wants me to stick with it,  saying that these side effects usually improve,  but It is been pretty miserable.  I am thinking I am going to stop taking it.  While Ozempic has been effective in regulating my sugars and losing weight,  I don not think it is worth the suffering that I have been enduring on this medication.  I understand that studies showed it causing thyroid cancer in mice,  but no one knows if it causes thyroid cancer in humans.  I don not want to be the guinea pig the drug makers use to find out it does. ",Ozempic
"Been on Ozempic since mid April 2020.  All side effects listed with the worst being chronic diarrhea.  Nausea has been significant,  but has settled to occasionally.  Trying to follow a more plant based diet I have lost today an official 60 pounds.  I find the less meat I eat,  the more energy I have,  the better my blood sugars are as well.  I am 53,  so weight loss isn not impossible for us older ladies. . . ",Ozempic
"I have been on 0. 5 Ozempic for 2 months now.  The nausea is no better.  I vomit almost every day.  Driving down the road and I begin to vomit.  Almost caused me to wreck my car twice now.  I have lost 30 pounds and feel terrible.  My stomach hurts all the time and now my back.  I do not urinate much at all even though I have increased water.  Calling today and going off it.  Losing weight is great,  but not at the cost of feeling horrible every day. ",Ozempic
"I have been taking Ozempic for 16 months and have lost 80Lbs!  I started at . 25 and have moved up to 1.  At first I was terribly sick but I took my time to adjust bit by bit while the dose was slowly raised and now I don not feel sick at all from it now!  If you can hold on and push through  the push was hard,  REALLY sick some days it does get better.  It has saved my life",Ozempic
"I was put on Ozempic after taking Gliperide for several years.  I started on 0. 25mg then on to 1mg.  I started having the nastiest burps ever,  then diarrhea 3 to 4 times a day.  After 3 months I went to a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with gastroparesis,  a side effect of Ozempic.  I  have all the side effects nasty , offensive smelling burps,  eye floaters in both eyes,  bad diarrhea,  stomach pain,  now this disease that has caused pre cancer cells.  Yes,  my appetite has decreased,  I have lost 15 lbs in 3 months,  my numbers are good.  But not worth being sick every day.  Just found out my daughter is going thru the same exact thing.  So take it at your own risk. ",Ozempic
Did the first 4 weeks o Ozempic  . 25 had mild stomach issues.  Nausea was come and go really not consistent.  Helped control my eating.  Dr said if you over eat or eat like you used to you will throw up.  There is no place for the over eating but up.  Didn not over eat didn not have much issue.  Took stool softener to keep things moving.  At the . 5 dose ate less but less side effects than my first dose.  Glad I have started the med it works. ,Ozempic
"I have been taking Ozempic for 4 months to reduce insulin resistance caused by polycystic ovary syndrome.   The medication has significantly reduced my appetite.   I have had a few minor side effects   a stomach cramp here,  an episode of diarrhea there. . . but nothing at all significant.   My weight went from 151 BMI 25. 9 to 133 three months later BMI 22. 8.   I honestly could not be happier. ",Ozempic
"I started taking Ozempic in June 2020,  initially lost 20 pounds by August.  Total of 30 pounds so far,  last 10 have been a lot slower.  I went from 186 pounds to 156 pounds.  A1c went from 6. 5 to 5. 6.   Minimal side effects include occasional nausea and constipation.  Started using miralax which has helped.  Side effects I have experienced are worth the benefits.  I consistently wake up with glucose levels in 80 90 range,  never out of green zone on glucometer.  I cannot over eat.  If I do I feel ill or get heartburn so I have learned my lesson.  I am really happy with this medication. ",Ozempic
"I took 1 dose of Ozempic and I have been sick ever since,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  nausea,  stomach cramps and a little dizziness.  This is terrible,   will never use again.  Can someone tell me how long these symptoms last? ",Ozempic
"Side effect is mild for me but it really destroys your appetite.  Initially I can only tolerate fresh fruits and vegetable.  I took this as opportunity to change my lifestyle.  I eat healthier and avoided sugary drinks.  I lost a total of 40 lbs.  in 6 months.  A1C dropped from 7. 3 to 5. 4.  Dress size dropped from 14 to size 4.  I am no longer on daily insulin,  BP meds and cholesterol meds.  All labs are normal.  This medication is my lifesaver. ",Ozempic
"I suffered from
 Loss of appetite 
 Exhaustion 
 Nausea 
 Vomiting once a week usually 2 days after my injection
 Low blood sugar events probably caused because just had no appetite

When I spoke to my pharmacist she encouraged me to try to hang in there telling me it would get better and it finally has.  I was not expecting it to take over 3 months though. 
My readings are all good and I have lost 28lbs so there were benefits to sticking it out but it was hard.  I had decided that I would continue to take the medication until my next appointment and if things were still bad I would tell the Dr that I  no longer wanted to use it.  Things are better and my appointment is next week. ",Ozempic
I have been on Ozempic for 8 weeks.  At first it I had side effects of  a lot of nausea.  Now I wake up cold and clammy the last week and very anxious.  Overall feeling unwell.  Wondering if anyone else has experienced this? ,Ozempic
"Honestly am so impressed so far with these meds.  My weight had 
 been creeping up due to insulin resistance which itself makes it harder to lose weight and PCOS.  My doctor recommended I try this in conjunction with a very low carb and calorie diet.  I started with a half dose of 0. 25mg once a week injection and then after 2 weeks up to 0. 5mg a week and so far in 6 weeks Ive lost 15cm from my waist and 9cm off my hips,  5cm off my bust.  I have been eating lite and easy roughly 1000 calories a day.  Havent weighed myself yet as Id prefer to see the difference in cm.  This medication makes me feel a little nauseous the first day or two after my shot but after that I never feel hungry.  I can quite easily eat a super small portion and feel full!  I drink about 2L of water a day and do about 8000 steps at my job.  It really has been great and sooooo much cheaper than Saxenda which was another one I was considering.  Hopefully I continue to lose weight! ",Ozempic
"I have been on it for 7 weeks.  I have had the runs as others have noted and the sour stomach,  but what I also noted is that those symptoms are worse if you have eaten too much,  or a heavier meal before bedtime.   Small snacks are ok.   

I don not drink any sugar laden beverages,  and I eat lots of fiber already.   My diet is mostly vegetarian,  but not for any reason other than my stomach just feels better on it.   I think that has helped keep the side effects in check. 

So far I have lost 8 lbs,  which TBH is kind of shocking.   I never thought my body would give up this weight,  but I am heading in the right direction.   Sugars are dropping nicely,  especially my fasting sugar.   I have that hypo drop and spike when you wake up,  and that seems to be levelling off,  which is great.   So I am going to keep going.  Oh and I didn not jump in with dosing,  I started with . 25 and kept on that for six weeks and only just now moving to . 5.   Slow gradual is the right way.   Too much at once will make you sick. ",Ozempic
"Listen to me  Ozempic will change your life  but you CANNOT eat synthetic sugar AT ALL.  I had severe hashimotos,  PCOS,  insulin resistance and severe diabetes symptoms.  HBA1C was high,  all cholesterols were high despite the healthiest of diets.  My numbers cleared from severe to perfect in 1 month! !  I had full body swelling,  severely cracked ankles,  swollen feet,  neck,  legs,  major hair loss a nightmare.  I began taking Ozempic  I was very sick.  It made me extremely nauseous  I got severe diarrhea,  but let me tell you  I lost 17 pounds of water weight in ONE month.  My dr couldnt believe it.  In four months,  I lost 40 lbs.  the nausea was mild to severe the entire time,  but the results were borderline insane.  It reset my metabolism,  took ALL of the inflammation away from my joints,  neck,  back,  my feet completely healed within one month.  Its barely believable.  I spent two months on . 25 and increased to . 5 once a week for ten more months.  High praise! ! ",Ozempic
"Ive been on Ozempic 6 months.  I had gestational diabetes with both children so know I have an increased risk of type 2.  I had bloodwork done and unsurprisingly my fasting sugar was high but my a1c was high normal.  My doctor prescribed Ozempic and I am currently at 1mg week.  Results blood sugar in perfect range,   lost 20 pounds 15 body weight,  loss of sense of taste for tons of foods,  alcohol aversion.  All in all Im far healthier but I do miss enjoying food.  I wonder if this is sustainable long term.  Time will tell. ",Ozempic
"I have been on Ozempic for 2. 5 weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds.  I dont eat anything fried or greasy.  I watch fat intake because this medicine can make you sick if you have too much fat in what you are eating.  It can also make you sick if you overeat.  If you eat small   moderate meals with light snacks in between,  you will probably not have any problems.  If you cannot stay away from fast food and greasy pizza,  you will have a problem.  I have found that this medicine makes me not as hungry.  It takes the edge off.  It also keeps me from craving junk.  I get full at meal time,  eating less.  I drink a lot of water too.  I also use an app on my phone to log food,  calories and exercise.  I weigh once a week.  I hope this helps someone else that is considering this drug. ",Ozempic
"I have tried them all!  I was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 18 and I will be 40 this September.  When I say I have tried them all,  its no exaggeration,  but my search stops here! !  This medicine has done in a couple of weeks what I have been trying to do all my adult life!  My blood sugar is perfect!  I actually look forward to testing my sugars throughout the day.  The other Day I cheated and have a slice of caramel cheesecake.  Normally,  this would spike my blood sugars too well over 250,  but when I tested my sugar one hour after consumption,  I was at 132! !  It only get lower as the night went on! !  This is some good stuff! !  I am so happy my doctor recommended this for me!  Im in love! !  Im finally optimistic about my future with this dreadful disease. ",Ozempic
"I have been using Ozempic for 18 months.  A1c has dropped from 8. 1 to 6. 0.  Weight dropped from 195lbs to 157lbs.  Minor side effects for the 1st two weeks,  I dropped most of the weight within 4 months and my A1c went down to 6. 3 in those 4 months.  My doctor decide to take me off Ozempic after 6 months to see if I would stabilized but within 4 weeks my A1c was back in the upper 7s.  I am staying on Ozempic for now.  Great medication but a ridiculous price. ",Ozempic
"My husband began taking Ozempic for his Type 2 diabetes several months ago and experienced minimal unpleasant side effects.  His food consumption is down approximately 23 no more first breakfast and second breakfast and first dinner and second dinner and he has been able to reduce his diabetes medications.  He has been steadily losing excess weight.  A bonus is the chronic loose stools he used to suffer have been eliminated.  

I started taking Ozempic for my Type 2 diabetes 6 weeks ago.  My food consumption is down significantly and I have been able to discontinue all other diabetes medications.  I have had some slight nausea and a mild bit of constipation,  both of which have been easily alleviated through dietary changes much smaller meals,  more fiber and more spicy food.  

We absolutely love this medication. ",Ozempic
"Started April 1.  2021 on Ozempic low dose.  3 weeks intervals it was increased.  Side effects were constipation  went on laxatives to help,  pain in my back severe,  bloating.  Week 11 increased to 1mg the side effects were major bloating,  diarrhea,  sounds in my stomach crazy,  nauseous,  feeling under the weather.  My appetite has decreased to the point that I only eat 2 meals a day that are small.  My sugar levels have decreased from 7. 1 5. 2 A1C.  Ive noticed that I have been kept awake some nights like Im nervous for some reason. ?  In the first 3 weeks Ive lost 15 pounds.  Havent checked since I want to wait but can feel difference .  The pains in the stomach are really uncomfortable and the bloating I will try gas x,  for relief.  When  I try to eat more than I should my body tells me that Im full if I go beyond that point I get severe pains in the stomach for hours.  But depends on what I eat.  Going to stay with smaller portionshealthier foods. ",Ozempic
"My health wasn not good so I fired the nurse practitioner I was seeing and got an internist doctor.  Found out my Thyroid  was almost non functional  high blood pressure  my pre diabetes rate was doing a serious climb.  1 year later had me at the right dose of synthroid. 
Doctor put me on metformin  phentermine  added ozempic 2 weeks later at . 25.  That was a rough ride,  I was nauseated  dizzy a lot!  I started at 265lbs and everyday I would see a pound or 2 come off.  As of this morning I weighed in at 239 and I am up to 1mg dose of ozempic weekly.  I take the anti nausea now just before my ozempic dose  that is it.  I use doterra ginger.  A1c down to 5!  I am glad I listened to my doctor  my pharmacist  stuck with it.  Anything worth having doesn not usually come easy!  I would like to get down to the 160 170 range,  I am 5'11 and thinner than that I start to look like Olive Oyl!  OH Popeye! ",Ozempic
"My doctor gave me Ozempic 0. 5 to start with.   I always had upset stomach,  diarrhea with most foods,  and an overall sick feeling all the time.   I was able to live with it until now.   She decided to up my dose to the 1. 0 and my body went into total chaos.   I am always nauseous,  constipated,  got reflux,  feels like my food is stuck in my stomach and doesn not go anywhere.   I am constantly burping and feeling bloated.   The sick feeling feels intensified and I cannot function at work.   I took my last one this past Friday night and was miserable all weekend long.   Today I am at work unable to function at my best because the nausea is bad.   I would say it is effective in lowering your blood sugar numbers and helping you loose weight but not worth feeling horribly sick over.  I will not be using this medication any longer. ",Ozempic
"Reading many of the reviews frightened me so I thought it was important to share my positive experience.  Ill first say,  Im horrified of needles.  However,  you cant feel the needle at all,  the medication going in sort of burns a bit,  but thats it!  Ive been on Ozempic for 5 months.  I started at 254 lbs and started taking 0. 25mg for 6 weeks.  No side effects in the slightest.  I also didnt lose much either though because it is your body getting used to the medication rather than fixing your blood sugars.  I then moved up to 0. 5 and started seeing results with my weight and still no bad side effects other than eating less.  I recently moved up to 1mg and am now down a total of 45 pounds in 5 months.  Still no bad side effects.  Eating has to be much more mechanical though because my hunger cues arent as strong,  but no nausea.  I would highly recommend this drug!  Ps inject in your thighs,  I believe this is the reason Ive had no bad side effects my entire journey! ",Ozempic
I have been on ozempic about 4 weeks now.  Started at 0. 25 now onto O. 5mg.  The only mild side effect I have is the sulphur burps other than that I don not really have any.  The odd sick feeling but it is not too strong of a feeling.  This medication has cut the sugar cravings in half to non  existent therefore have lost bit of weight which is noticeable.  Food habits now are also none existant.  I feel fuller for longer.  This drug is amazing and to only Inject once weekly is fab!  I do recommend ozempic highly.  I Held a lot of weight around my stomach to which now its starting to shift.  To me it is been a lifechanger and I hope to anyone considering reaps the same experience from myself on it.  Gl x,Ozempic
"Since starting Ozempic all my numbers have gotten considerably better.  I did have nausea for several months,  but I took medicine to counteract the nausea and now Im feeling much better.   My appetite has been cut in half.   I have lost a total of 40 lbs so far and I couldnt tell you the amount of inches I have lost,  it seems that I lost inches first and then weight.  I have started going to the gym.  My advice to anyone starting Ozempic is to stop eating as soon as you get that first feeling of being full,  dont try to finish the plate just because you dont want to waste food,  because it will make you sick if you force yourself to eat it all. ",Ozempic
"With an A1C approaching 11,  it was time to try something else in addition to Novolog and Tresiba so my Dr added Ozempic. 
I also quit all alcohol and became a vegetarian.  The first 3 weeks at . 25 left me with a decreased appetite,  nothing severe.  The pounds started dropping off,  fast forward 3 months and I am 22 lbs lighter. 
I love Ozempic,  no bad side effects and my insulin needs have decreased  not gone away best of all my A1C was 7! 
A lifestyle change helped a lot,  but I credit Ozempic for many of these positive changes. ",Ozempic
"It really helps,  especially if you are eating the correct foods.  Sometimes the side effects are feeling really bloated.  I started off with 0. 25 then moved up to 0. 5.  Watch your sugar intake though,  you may get dizzy spells if too many sweets. ",Ozempic
"I feel that the best practice for this medicine would be to take about only 8 10 clicks 17 clicks  0. 25 for the first several weeks and then build yourself up to the full 0. 25 dose.   That way you can see what side effects you are going to experience and if they are tolerable of not.   I took 0. 25 and suffered from severe diarrhea for almost the full 7 days.  Ended up in the hospital for the last 4 days until the side effects wore off.  The only positive,  was that I lost almost 20lbs.  I would be very careful taking this medicine. ",Ozempic
"I have been using this off label for weight loss for 3 months after consistent dietexercise and allegedly controlled Hashimoto is left me frustrated that I still couldn not lose weight.   This drug has been amazing.   I do still suffer from occasional headaches that are moderate to severe and if I eat something I shouldn not there are usually digestive repercussions.   But I am down 15 pounds in 3 months without any real change to my prior very good lifestyle.   I lean into the days I am not hungry,  and allow myself to eat on the days that I am.   It is expensive,  but there are great coupons.   I will stay at the . 5 until I reach my goal weight and then try to taper off. ",Ozempic
"Do not take this medication!   After injecting the . 5 mg dosage for two months,  I began to have digestive issues.  My doctor sent me for medical tests and found that I developed Pancreatitis. 
I was told to stop using Ozempic immediately! ",Ozempic
Ive been taking Ozempic for eight months.  Ive had minimal side effects on a . 5mg dose.  Im taking this for weight loss with Metformin and a low carb diet.  Ive lost 70 pounds from 265 lbs to 195 lbs.  The change in my health has been remarkable.  I call it the wonder drug. ,Ozempic
"Hi!  

Have been on Ozempic for 10 months.  The first 3 months were very difficult with strong side effects.  Mainly constant,  but low level,  nausea,  occasional vomiting,  and diarrhea especially two days after the injection.  However around month 3 the nausea and diarrhea subsided greatly and my appetite returned.  I had lost weight very quickly 42lbs in 3 months due to not really eating much.  Had to take supplements for a while but am now eating well.  The rapid weight loss led to telogen effluvium,  a temporary hair loss condition.  I shedded A LOT but never showed any baldness or anything.  Currently,  my weight is still down I was taken off my blood pressure medication! ,  my blood counts are perfect,  my hair is getting thick,  and I eat normally.  I now experience virtually no side effects.   Really,  really,  glad I stuck out the side effects at the beginning. ",Ozempic
"I have been on Ozempic for 6 months now.  After the first few injections,  I was so sick vomiting and diarrhea all the time.  I called the doc and said I couldnt take this anymore.  Of course I lost weight,  as I couldnt keep anything in me.  I researched the medication itself to understand exactly what it was  how it worked.  I decided to stay on it.  My A1c was 8. 8 when I started.  3 months later,  6. 4.  I am down 36 pounds.  I have been exercising regularly for 3 months now,  running 3. 5 miles 5 X a week.  The confidence and energy from the weight loss outweighs all the negative side affects in the beginning for me!   Blood sugar control is excellent,  and I suspect will only improve after the continued weight loss.  I have stalled with weight loss twice now,  but not giving up,  and sticking to my exercise changing it up a bit to gain more muscle to burn fat,  I have been able to overcome the stalls and continue to lose.  Complete game changer medication for me! ! ",Ozempic
"Used Ozempic for 2 months,  had to stop taking it.  I had themost toxic reactions  from any prescription drug I have ever taken.   Terrible chemical smelling burps,  felt sick often,   caused serious bowel problems.   Will never take this drug again,  benefits are not worth the grief. ",Ozempic
"Ive been on this med for 7 weeks.  Ive lost 25 lbs and my daily blood sugars range from 60   90.  I use along with 500 mg Metformin.  First couple of weeks was hard with nausea and stomach cramps.  I also had the headaches that others have mentioned the first couple of days.  Week 3 I increased from 0. 25 to 0. 50.  Then came the diarrhea.  Not too bad,  I was just happy that I could go.  Im now taking 1. 0 and the sulphuric burping.  Ugh!  After doing some research on home remedies to help with the belching,  Im trying a spoon of apple cider vinegar.  If you can make it through the first few weeks and you can be somewhat disciplined you will notice a huge difference in how you feel.  In my opinion,  the side effects are manageable when I compare the weight gain while taking Insulin.  BTW   Im not severely obese.  Prior to being on this drug,  my weight was 205 and Im 59 and 47 years old.  I hope this is helpful to someone. ",Ozempic
Well so far and this is my 3rd week I am taking it  for weight loss only and I am a little sick in my stomach .  But no throwing up or bad gas.  Fingers crossed I hope I don not.  Some of these side effects sound awful.  I have lost about 2 pounds a week so far and if this keeps up I am going all the way with this .  I take . 25 so far.  My doctor wanted me to try because I have lost 275 pounds all by my self and I have been at a stand still.  He wants me to get over this hump.  So I am trying this  and so far so good.  I hope it continues to good for me.  I hate it is not for some . .  And by the way I have never had diabetes.  So I am taking only for weight issues.  I am 50 and its took me 4 years to lose the 275lb,Ozempic
I have taken ozempic for four days and have not experienced any of the symptoms others are saying they have had with one exception I am very tired.   I am  eating a little less but do not feel like some say they can not eat at all.    My bs is down to 110 and I have lost three pounds.    So far I see only good things.    I hope it stays that way as I want to lose about 30 pounds and not take metformin.   Hopeful! ! ! ! ,Ozempic
"I have been on ozempic for 13 weeks,  I started out on . 25 mg for 4 weeks then moved up to . 5 mg for 2 weeks and then to the 1 mg.  My A1C was 10. 9 when I started the injection and after 12 weeks my A1C was 7. 6 and I have lost 34lbs!  I am feeling great and I continue to lose weight.  I am so thankful for this injection! ",Ozempic
"Have been on Ozempic for 3 months.  Minimal side effects.  With a diet change no more chips,  booze,  and candy and exercise,  I was able to reduce me A1C from 11 to 5. 8.  I lost 70 pounds.  Ever since Ozempic,  I find it keeps my sugar consistent at 110 or under,  even on cheat days.  Mild stomach pain.  It has reduce my hunger as others commented.  While I am responsible for much of weight loss,  the Ozempic had a strong role in it as well. ",Ozempic
"On week 4 now,  honestly the first 2 weeks were a nightmare,  doctors dont tell you stay away from fatty foods and dont over eat if they did I wouldnt have had the most horrible sulphur burps that made my eyes water ,  projectile vomiting,  diarrhoea and stomach pain not to mention constant nausea even during night ,  I finally figured out not to eat too much and avoid fatty foods completely! !  This was a game changer and now Im doing ok,  lost 21 pounds so far which is mad but mostly because in 2 weeks Ive eaten probably 4000 calories.  Im back to wanting to eat again but have to control myself or face the terrible consequences.  Blood sugars are all over the place as you can imagine however insulin sensitivity is way better.  Just takes time to get used to,  hope this helps",Ozempic
"This medicine did what it was supposed to.  It lowered my A1C,  but it also almost me off.  I was so sick.  I had to stop it.  The worst medicine ever!  I felt like I was reaching the end of my life.  I couldn not do anything,  couldn not eat,  couldn not even get out of bed.  I lost a lot of weight!  My stomach hurt,  my side hurt,  my back hurt.  I started feeling better once I quit taking it!  I will never take it again!  It almost felt like it was poisoning my entire body! ",Ozempic
"Take my comments for what they are worth since I changed many things in my life at the same time. . . but. . 

I think Ozempic is great.   After 5 months reduced my A1c from 9. 7 to 5. 9.   Lost almost 25 pounds.   Am at . 5mg and it has drastically reduced my appetite.   Between smaller stomach and this drug often push my plate away before finishing,  rarely desire for dessert.   

Little to no side effects overall.   Some stomach issues like constipation,  bloating but cant rule out dietary changes being the cause also.   Went on a low carb diet and really stuck to it for once and increased exercise a lot.    Use of the Freestyle Libre Sensor really really helped too!   Being able to learn how things effect your blood sugar in real time is a great motivator to do the right thing,  combine carbs with protein etc

Hoping to lower other meds I am on when I see my Doctor next month.   Once a week tiny needle virtually pain free is a far better system than pills everyday. ",Ozempic
I have taken opzempic for a month now dosage being 0. 25 once a week and at first I didnt really see any side affects or anything but then boy one day I made the mistake and over ate and had gas constantly and kept burping repeatedly and then and hour later non stop diarrhea.  After making that mistake I have taken into account never by any means do that again.  I usually now just eat a big breakfast and like a snack later on throughout the day and its helped me completely cut out soda entirely.  I originally started taking this because I was experiencing rapid weight gain and they checked my thyroid and said it was within normal limits so they put me on this and I am so glad.  I wake up in the morning and I havent had a blood sugar reading over 130 in a month I cant wait to go back to my doctor and figure out what my A1C is.  But in total Ive lost 8 pounds in one month ,Ozempic
My doctor says my A1C is down.  I lost about 20 pounds.  The weight loss stopped about a month ago.  I have had most of the side effects listed along with substantial hair loss.  My hair got excessively dry and brittle and does not respond to any counter treatment. ,Ozempic
"Been taking for 18 months.   I have lost 50 pounds.   My last two labs 3 months apart,  A1C 5. 2 and 5. 3.   Along with Ozempic,  I take Jardiance and Metformin.   I have no craving for my former favorite foods.   Honestly,  I get no pleasure from eating.   It works for me,  my miracle drug. ",Ozempic
"I have been prescribed Ozempic for weight loss secondary to type 2.  I got nauseated with some loss of appetite at . 25 mg dosage and adapted to it over a month.  Lost 9 lbs in that month.  I increased to 0. 5 mg last Friday it is Tuesday,  and I am miserable.  Non stop nausea,  burping,  some pain in stomach,  constipated.  I feel miserable.   I am worried about the stomach pain being pancreatitis starting so I am increasing my water.  I haven not eaten in two days.   I will not continue with this drug as I thin this just cannot be a good thing to do to ones body. ",Ozempic
"Started Ozempic 8 weeks ago,  from the beginning I started belching.  Doze was . 25 went to .  50 and the stomach cramps started.  I am in 3 weeks now at 1mg and I have never been more miserable.  Constant violent diarrhea and stomach cramps.  I am losing weight at a rapid pace didnt necessarily need to lose.  I called the doctor today because Im unable to leave the house she seems to think that this will subside in another week and I should be back to normal.  After reading everyones comments I find this hard to believe! ! ! ! ",Ozempic
It is the miracle drug it reduced my A1C from 11. 3 to 5. 4 so far being taking it for a little over one year lost some weight no side effects whatsoever since the first dosage quit taking metformin do watch my sugar intake not religiously but moderate It does work! price with insurance its only 25 dollars compared with 800 and something  without insurance highly recommended,Ozempic
"I am male early 50s.  Blood glucose was already regulated with metformin,  diet,  and exercise 100 to 150,  but I wanted to quit metformin because of its side effects diarrhea.  I was put on 0. 50 mgwk and warned that nausea from Ozempic was a common side effect.  I HAD NO IDEA!  WEEK 1WEEK 2 I couldn not smell food without getting queasy.  I choked down lots of soup just to get 1200 calday often falling short.  WEEK 3WEEK 4 got slightly better.  WEEK 5 I have my appetite back.  I feel full,  so I eat smaller meals.  My weight loss is atypical 203 lbs to 183 lbs in five weeks,  combined with exercise 1 hr4x wk stationary biketreadmill.  Blood glucose is now between 90 and 120,  with occasional dips and peaks.  I would only recommend this drug to those who have very high glucose levels,  are morbidly obese,  fiercely stubborn,  andor desperate.  But it works.  Good luck. ",Ozempic
"Ozempic has been a life changing medicine for me.  My A1C is better controlled and I have have lost around 13 pounds so far and have not even been on it that long.  Before ozempic,  I craved sweets and was constantly hungry ozempic has greatly helped me regulate my appetite.  If I eat too much I do have problems with nausea,  so I do have to be careful,  but thats a good side effect I think",Ozempic
I have lost more than 30 lbs.  In the 3 months I have been on it.  For the first month I had a mild sour stomach but it wasn not that bad.  I feel fine now and am still loosing weight.  My blood tests are within normal ranges.  I feel fine.  I am in my 50s and haven not been this weight since my teens. ,Ozempic
"Started taking Ozempic for pre diabetes and insulin resistance.   This is first medication I have ever taken for diabetes.   A1c was 5. 7.   I increased dose quickly at doctor is recommendation if little to no side effects occurred.   First dose 0. 25 in office.   Second 0. 5 a week later.   Third dose at 1. 0 a week after that.   Only side effect I have is mild nausea.   Appetite has disappeared and I eat only when hungry and much smaller portions.   Serious bloating when I eat too much,  which is a great deterrent.   Been on medication 4 weeks overall,  2 weeks at 1. 0,  weigh dropped from 305 lbs.  to 295 lbs.   Still a little lethargic but I was very lethargic before starting medication.   I feel like this medicine is a game changer for me.   I love not thinking about food all of the time,  only eating when hungry and not for pleasure,  and losing weight.   Will retest A1c in 2 months.   Hopefully the weight loss continues and I caught the A1c level before it turns into full blown diabetes. ",Ozempic
"Im a nurse.  I started this med and unfortunately the nausea,  gastritis,  dizziness and headache continuing into week 4 is simply not worth it.   I cant lay in bed and be miserable which is what this does to me.  At first I actually thought I had a GI Bug.  If there is any other choice do not put yourself through this. ",Ozempic
"Well,  let me start by saying Ozempic worked very well for me.   I was on it for a little over 4 months.   I lost 49 pounds,  my a1c went from over 9 to 6. 7,  I am off insulin now.   Then we went to a higher deductible insurance plan and I can no longer afford my Ozempic.   The only thing they offer is the 150 savings card,  so it still costs over 600 a month.  I can have a roof over my head or get my meds.   What a world we live in.   I guess I should quit my job,  then I could get some assistance with it. ",Ozempic
"I started Ozempic in July 2020.   The first few weeks I had slight nausea.   Now,  10 months in Ive lost 50lbs   210lb to 158lb and my sugar levels if anything are on the low side.   Ive just stopped taking my Metformin as they were dropping too much.   I didnt even make it to the 1mg,  stopping at the . 5mg.   If you can last the first 4 weeks,  its amazing.   The only side effect I have is a little constipation which I control with PEG  when needed.   It has changed my life!   I feel like a brand new woman! ",Ozempic
I have been taking Ozempic for about 2 months to lower my Diabetes 2.   It is been great my numbers were 200 to 300 they are now 100  134.  My A1c was 9. 8 it is now 6. 1 and I have lost 12 lbs and still loosing.   I am also taking Synjardy XR a combination of Metformin  Jardiance my number are great.  I eat extremely less on the Ozempic.  My only side affect has been an occasional headache but nausea was brutal.  I was getting very nauseated after eating and taking Synjardy xr until I heard about ZOFRAN let me just say if you have nausea and are taking Metformin with Ozempic PLEASE ask your doctor for a prescription of ZOFRAN I got the generic ONDANSETRON 4mg I take it 20 minutes after I eat and have taken my metformin I NO LONGER get nausea.  Zofran will definitely help with nausea if you are feeling sick.  You will thank me later. ,Ozempic
"I am a 70 year old type 2 diabetic and was taking one Metformin 500 ER for the past year or so.   My A1C was 11 and it dropped to 5. 6 by changing my diet and taking the metformin. 

My doctor wanted me to try Ozempic to help me lose weight and possibly eliminate the metformin.  The side effects were terrible right from the start.   Nausea and diarrhea,  no vomiting just nausea.   I started at . 25 and am now up to 1. 0.  

My appetite is gone completely.   I have no desire to eat at all.   When I  do eat,   I get full almost immediately.   I have gone from 228lb down to 202lb in the six weeks I have been taking ozempic.  I am thrilled with the weight lose,  and the nausea and diarrhea have improved. 

However,  I have almost stopped peeing.   I go in the morning,  then go all day into the evening without going.   Since I suffer from incontinence,  it is good,  but I am worried that it might be damaging my kidneys.   

I hope I don not have to stop taking it,  at least till I lose another 50 pounds or so. ",Ozempic
"Blood sugar levels started getting hight 33 a year ago,  tried several different prescriptions before being placed on Ozempic 4 months ago,  metformin  invokana.   Now reading 6. 5 levels,  with a recent 7. 0 A1C.   In the past 4 months have gone from 170 to 141 lbs.   I was told weight loss included muscle loss so Im trying to keep on a high protein diet and weight workouts.   I dont think Ive had a hunger pang in 4 months,  and eat way less.   I do get burps after eating and occasional stomach pain that is tolerable.   Perhaps its the combination of all bringing down my levels that gives me two things I didnt expect,  clear clarity in thinking better memory recall and a lot more energy as in stable for a good 10 hours and then I start getting fatigued.   I honestly am very happy to lose weight and eat off a smaller plate. ",Ozempic
"Today is day 10 on . 25 mg of Ozempic,  so 2 doses in.  On day 7 dose 2 injection day I could not leave the toilet.  Exhausted and cold.  Never any desire to eat,  even if I havent eaten for 24 hours.  When I do eat something it is a tiny portion and I feel incredibly sick for an hour or so afterwards.  Last night I had horrifying nightmares.  I cannot wait for this to wear off,  I will change my lifestyle long before I take another dose of this medication. ",Ozempic
This is my 8th week and using 0. 5.   I lost 12lb and I have more energy now so I go to exercise as well now.   Only on the first week I have heavy headache but it was gone on my second week.   I thought of stopping it after first week due to the headache but luckily I continued and I am having happy life now. ,Ozempic
"Been using ozempic for 7 weeks lost 12 pounds  i also take xzando and lantus at night.  Gas, nausea,  headache and a few low A1c.  But my number is down fron 8. 1 to 5. 4. 
For the Gas I find that Gas X helps.  And the nausea i sip on cold water and keep your meals small.  I dont throw up yet and no constipation or Diarrhea. ",Ozempic
"This Ozempic was prescribed as a last ditch effort to get my A1C down prior to starting insulin.  The first . 25 dose caused significant nausea but I battled through it for a couple weeks before starting the . 50 dose.  The nausea increased with the higher dose and I considered stopping but had lost ten pounds and had zero appetite and my sugar was down so chose to continue.  It is been about 6 months now,  I am taking the full 1. 0 dose and although the nausea is still an issue it has lessened in severity and comes in waves so I know it will pass and just tough it through.  I have dropped about 30 lbs and counting,  my A1C is now in the prediabetic range and I have been able to lower doses of other medications that were causing significant side effects.  I now feel better,  look better,  have more energy and no longer have the constant food cravings or desire to overeat.  If you can ride out the nausea the benefits of ozempic are huge,  for me anyway. ",Ozempic
"The first few weeks I suffered some nausea and my food intake was reduced probably about 30 as a result.  I started at . 25 for a month then . 50 for a month then 1. 00 which was full dose.  I have been on the drug for about 6 months now.  My weight dropped 30 pounds from 264 pounds to 234 pounds and I seem to be levelling at that range.  My target BMI weight for 6 foot 3 is 210 but I would be happy at 225.  
I have found that Ozempic did cause some constipation but overall once I achieved the full dose for a few weeks I felt much better.   The weight loss has really helped how I feel and I will
Be doing my 6 month blood work up next week.  Hoping to see some good results with glucose which was at 6. 0 and cholesterol at 259.  Overall I am very happy with the results to date. ",Ozempic
"Been taking Ozempic for two weeks now.   I wondered how this drug could allow some   or most   people to lose weight.   Now I know   it makes you feel sort of sick to your stomach,  and takes away your appetite   at least that is my result so far.   I am hoping to develop a tolerance to it.    Not a real pleasant experience so far,  but I have not vomited or had diarrhea as some  users have reported.   It does appear to be lowering my blood glucose somewhat,   which is the primary reason I am taking it.   I am also taking metformin but have been able to reduce the dosage.   Still only taking . 25 mg of Ozempic so result of higher dosages is unknown now.   Will post again in a month or two with higher dosage usage results. ",Ozempic
"I have taken 4,  14 shots and it is not good.  The first two weeks were great.  I had no hunger after dinner time.  Even though I would stand in front of the fridge and look in,  I would not take anything out for a snack.  I take my shot on Saturday mornings at 8 am.  Now,  Monday the 19th,  I got sick.  It was 8 pm and I regurgitated everything,  or so I thought.  Then explosives were set off in my anus.  At times,  for the next 12 hours,  I was sitting on the pot while regurgitating into the trash bin.  I kept drinking my Docs said to drink Power Ade.  But it was like there was a throughway from my mouth straight out the dark side.  It took until Thursday before I was strong enough to do anything.  Any ideas how to stop this from happening again?  Please,  I need some help. ",Ozempic
"I was moved to Ozempic from Januvia.  At the time I started Ozempic,  I would brought my blood sugar down to what would translate to an A1C of 5. 5 or so,  and I would managed to kick most of the insulin I was on.  I started Ozempic at 0. 25 units per week and had mild nausea and diarrhea,  but my appetite vanished and I could barely bring myself to eat.  Once I started the full dose,  my blood sugars began to climb rapidly.  I would be fine in the mornings at first and then experience wild spikes between meals,  until finally my fasting sugar started to climb out of my desired range.  I actually had to take MORE insulin,  not less,  just to keep my fasting BG below 7.  Ozempic was absolutely NOT worth it   even with the lower price here in Canada,  the cost is ridiculous,  the benefits never materialized and the effects on my appetite destroyed the healthy diet I was trying to eat.  Good example of how new isn not always good. ",Ozempic
"I have been on Ozempic for 2. 5 months now 10 weeks as of today off label for PCOS.  I started with a dose of . 25 for the first four weeks,  and have been on . 5 for the remaining six.  On the . 25 dose,  I felt my appetite was slightly reduced and I had some mild nausea.  As soon as I went to . 5,  the side effects started and I started getting extreme nausea,  diarrhea,  rancid burps,  and I can no longer eat.  If I eat more than a regular ham and cheese sandwich in a day,  I feel extremely nauseous and the burps come back.  As of my last doctor is appointment I have lost about 3 pounds,  but I don not know if I can keep this up.  I am miserable. 

I won not know until next month whether it is working like my doctor has intended because she needs blood tests to verify all of that,  so I can not speak to how effective it has been yet. ",Ozempic
"I have been on Ozempic semaglutide for 7 weeks and am presently on . 50mg dose.  Positives   I have lost 15 pounds,  my A1c has dropped from 6. 8 to 6. 0.  I feel great.  Negatives    Blood level dropped fast with the first shot,  after that no issues,  slight nausea right after the shot.  It doesn not last more than 30 mins.  
Positives outweigh the negatives IMO",Ozempic
"I can barely eat or even drink water.   Sure,  my blood sugars are low,  but I can not even eat 300 calories a day on this,  it is like chemically induced anorexia.   Extreme weight loss thru starvation is not something I consider a treatment.   Extreme Nausea is after even every sip of water.   It took me 3 hrs to eat 12 c of plain oatmeal today   one of the few things that doesn not make it worse. 

I need a therapy that is life sustaining,  and includes healthy diet.   Under 300 calories a day is not healthy. ",Ozempic
"Started Ozempic about 7 weeks ago.   Dosage . 25.   First week noticed some nausea,  a lot of gas,  some reflux and  diarrhea.   Each week side effects were getting worse.   Nausea very bad,  pains in left side,  waves of heat,  no energy an all In all just feeling BAD!   Diarrhea is bad and a bit uncontrollable.   Have not raised dosage due to being afraid of worse side effects.    Have lost 5 pounds.   Appetite is definitely less.   My sugar numbers have not improved that much,  which leads me to believe it is what I am eating.   I still crave sweets.   I have some jittery feelings at times!   I am very discouraged. ",Ozempic
"I started taking this 3 weeks ago.   I didnt really have any terrible side effects other than fatigue,  but after my third injection,  nausea,  diarrhea and stomach pain hit me with a vengeance.   I feel like I ate rotten eggs.   Im not sure I want to continue taking this.   I might try injecting it in my thigh like some others have tried.   I hope it works because my  glucose readings have been in the 90s to 120. ",Ozempic
"I started Ozempic on Friday.   I am hoping the side effects go away because it has helped my BS readings and helped with cravings.   The side effects I am having is horrible diarrhea,  joint and muscle pain and fatigue.    I don not know how long these symptoms will last but hopefully not long. ",Ozempic
"I was on ozempic . 5 for 6 months,  during that time I had severe stomach cramps,  diarrhea.   My blood pressure went out of control causing my vision to double,  I have 6th cranial nerve palsy caused by spike in blood pressure,  EKG now shows I have a right bundle branch blockage,  may need a pacemaker.   I never had anything like this before,  I have had the same dr for 15 years,  and he is also concerned.   I believe the Ozempic is the root cause,  my eyesight may not get completely normal.   Will be getting legal advice",Ozempic
"So far very positive except for today.  I experienced diarrhea and vomiting all at once.  About 15 minutes after this began,  I felt completely better.  I just hope it was a one time occurrence.  Ive been on Ozempic for many months,  and this was my first episode.  On the other hand,  my A1c is below 7,  my daily glucose tests are way down,  and I have lost over 20 pounds,  perhaps more.  My dose is 1mg per week with an easy to administer shot.  But the bottom line is you must work with the drug.  You wont be hungry,  but that never stopped people like us from eating anyway.  Listen to your body.  If you are not hungry,  dont eat! ",Ozempic
"A1C was 6. 2 with Metformin.  Went on Ozempic for 3 months.  I had side effects of bad nausea,  vomiting,  and watery diarrhea.   Lost 27 lbs.  Couldn not eat 47 days.  My A1C now 5. 6  and it is not worth it for me. ",Ozempic
Ozempic is a nasty drug to take.   I have been on the toilet 8   10 times per day even on just a low . 25 mg dosage.   It does however lower my blood glucose better than anything else I have taken in the past. ,Ozempic
"I started Ozempic in March 2019.  This allowed me to quit taking actose and Glipizide.  I weighed 287 lbs.  and my A1C was 7. 8 and rising.  I was a little nauseous for the first week and then it subsided Ive not experienced any since.  Now in October I weighed in at 231 and my A1C is down to 6. 2.  My energy is up and I feel great.  This medicine definitely improved my quality of life.  Ive never gone beyond the . 5 dosage and my endocrinologist said that an increase is not necessary for me.  I would recommend everyone give it a chance,  I know it wont be for everyone but if it works your daily life will change for the better. ",Ozempic
"Started taking Ozempic back in February after I asked my doctor to put me on it because of reading a British study on weight loss by semaglutide.   Started at the . 25 mg level for three weeks.  Went to . 50 for another four weeks and have been on 1 mg thereafter.   No serious side effects apart from some belching,  acid reflux after bedtime and rare diarrhea.   Significant loss of appetite,  change of taste in foods,  change of perceived texture of foods,  significant reduction in alcohol enjoyment and intake,  and increased sensitivity to cold.   My A1C has gone from 6. 7 to 6. 0,  and I have lost over 35 pounds since the start.   My cholesterol is down to 115 and LDL down to 50,  something I have never seen before.   Overall,  the results far outweigh the downsides of this drug and it has provided the most positive results faster than any other medication I have tried before. ",Ozempic
"I have been taking Ozempic for four months.  Initially,  I had a headache for several hours after each injection,  but that stopped after a few weeks.  I can not eat many carbs or I will get nauseous,  so I am having to change eating habits which is good for my long term health.  My A1C has dropped almost a whole point from 6. 8 to 5. 9 which is awesome.  In addition,  I have lost about a pound a week,  so I am down 15 pounds at this point without exercise.  I want to exercise but haven not been able to due to a knee injury.  Probably the best part of this medicine is that I am not hungry all the time like I was for so many years.  I can eat normal or even small portions for the first time and even skip meals sometimes.  People don not understand what it is like to be hungry from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed and even wake up hungry during the night.  This medicine has been life changing for me.  I am finally able to eat like a normal person. ",Ozempic
"I have lost 60 lbs in a year and a half on the diabetic dosage of 1 mg.   I started on . 25mg in January 2020 for 4 weeks,  went to . 5mg thru June,  then 1 mg.   Other than having to reduce back to . 5 mg for 4 weeks in October 2020 due to some increased nausea,  I remained on 1 mg weekly dose.  Yes there was some nausea,  but Ozempic actually worked on appetite control and reduced cravings for large amounts of desserts,  pasta,  and other foods.   This was accomplished even without much change in activity or food choice,  strictly in food volume.    Despite losing a few lbs with other GLP 1 drugs in the past,  Ozempic clicked for me 214 down to 153. ",Ozempic
"I have been on Ozempic for 3 months now and I find this drug works like none I have tried before.  The first 6 weeks were rough,  burping,  headaches,  fatigue,  nausea,  but I stuck it out.  Im so glad I did.  My A1C has gone from 8 to 6. 8 in three months.  I have lost 20 pounds,  gone from 180 160lbs.  And my sugars on the daily have seen a vast improvement.  The major thing I have noticed is after being on the drug for this long that recovery time after eating a high carb or high sugar food is back to normal.  Appetite is still lacking but its mostly an aversion to bad food.  I can no longer sit and eat an entire burger,  its just way to much,  but a healthy salad,  I can eat the whole thing!  I have seen major benefits from this drug.  I have way more energy,  and no more 3pm crash.  Tips while adjusting to the drugs tums,  gravol,  lots of sleep,  light healthy meals,  and remember to drink water!  Also I found injecting Ozempic in the hip lessened the symptoms for the first while. ",Ozempic
"Horrible experience.  After the first injection,   woke up in the middle of the night with horrible heartburn.  Then started projectile vomiting,  uncontrollably for the next two days.  I was so weak and dehydrated that I had to get fluids by iv.  On the fourth day,  I still cannot eat and was still sick to my stomach.  These are evil meds and will never inject myself with this stuff again.  Just awful. ",Ozempic
"The side effects of my gastrointestinal symptoms have made this drug intolerable to me.  While my A1C is now down to 6. 1 from 7,  at my age,  7 is still considered an acceptable result.  So in my estimation,  it has not been worth the severe cramps,  diarrhea,  headaches,  blurred vision,  and dizziness I have experienced. ",Ozempic
"Do not use this drug.  I took my first and only dose and had terrible diarrhea,  so bad I had to cancel several engagements.  I also had vomiting after eating no appetite a decline in vision,  and worst was a mental haziness that took over a month to recover from.   My doctor called it an allergic reaction but I dont believe that.  Even after 8 months I still have episodes of feeling tired and hazy.  I feel like Ive aged  5 years since taking the one dose.  Other than type 2 diabetes I was in good physical condition and health.  Now I have aching muscles,  reduced vision,  and sporadic haziness.  Yes,  my A1C went down temporarily,  but not worth all the rest of the side effects. ",Ozempic
"I have been using Ozempic since February 2019.  The medication has lowered my A1C tremendously 7. 1 to 5. 6 in 6 months.  However,  my nausea still hasn not gone away.  I started with . 25 and tried moving up 2 clicks,  but the nausea was terribly worse.  After talking with my endocrinologist,  he suggested I move back down to the . 25 to see if that would help.  Unfortunately,  it has not.  I still get nauseated about 2 12 days after my injection.  It last about 5 hours and then I feel better.  I have had to decide does the good outweigh the bad and in my case it does.  I can tell you that I have lost about 20 lbs,  since February with the mediation.  My appetite is really small compared to what it was before.  I can also tell you that on the Ozempic if I overeat or eat heavily processed,  sugary,  or fried foods,  I do get a severe sour stomach and terrible sulphur burps.  The doctor explained why this happens and now I realize how to better maintain my diet while I am on the medication. ",Ozempic
"Diabetic  prescribed Ozempic . 25 once weekly for a month  . 50 once weekly for the 2nd month.  Then increased to 1.  1xwkly thereafter.  By time I hit the first week on . 50,  I was having  daily  nausea.  I called provider  told to start the . 50 to see if body could adjust.  By 2nd dose,  I had severe daily nausea culminating in volatile vomiting to the  point I was severely limited in maintaining daily activities.  I made decision to stop medication  notified doctor that body could not handle.  By this time,  I was experiencing constant belly pain.  It hurt to drink water  eat as would throw it up.  This was the worse experience  agitated that it will take 5 long weeks to clear my system.  I am thinking it should have stopped sooner. ",Ozempic
"I have been using ozempic for 3 weeks now.   I am down 4 lbs.  And have had a little constipation the first week. . . and then  loose to normal b. ms.   I have no headaches,  no vomiting,  no bad tastes.

Very small appetite,  very slow motility,  oscillate between constipation and diarrhea.  It is a great drug,  I had to buy a new wardrobe.  I look and,  for the most part,  I feel great. ",Ozempic
"Started with . 25 for 4 weeks than . 5 after that.   I don not have much of an appetite,  which is good because I do need to lose weight.  I can not finish a portion of food I usually eat.   I have pain,  burping and constipation daily.     I am OK in morning when I wake up and after breakfast eggs,  or oatmeal,  or yogurt.     I usually eat lunch supper at 2 3 pm.   The real pain and burning start 3 4 hours later and lasts till I go to bed.   If I drink water it gets worse.   When I lay in bed the pain goes away.    I have not had problems with indigestion so I wonder if this is causing it?   I worry about kidney and pancreatitis.   I will see my MD this coming week and discuss all this with him.   I lost 10 lbs and my A1C went from 10. 3 to 9. 1.   Wonder how long it takes for the A1C to get below 7? ",Ozempic
"First injected dose Sunday night.  Wee hours Monday the nausea started.  No vomiting emetophobic here!  Monday all day nausea that I could handle took a Zofran,  Tuesday afternoon hit with sudden stomach cramping and diarrhea.  Those nasty sulphuric burps all Tuesday evening and over night,  diarrhea all night and now its Wednesday morning and still watery diarrhea.  My stomach has been rumbling and terribly bloated since Tuesday afternoon.  I need to lose 70 lbs but this is NOT worth it! !  Who wants days and weeks of feeling HORRIBLE! ? !  Ill lose weight another way!  I have sleep apnea and am 56,  so want to be healthy but this drug is Not recommended unless you need to lose weight to stay alive.

"I am on my 4th week of Ozempic 0. 25,  0. 25,  0. 50,  0. 50 and have experienced very little in the way of side effects.  A little upset stomach in the first hour of injection but after that it has been smooth sailing. 

I have lost 20lbs using this along with Farxiga and doing KETO with intermittent fasting. ",Ozempic
"I have been taking this medicine for the past 4 weeks 0. 25 and have been very sick.  I have very bad stomach pains with a cramp on the lower left side of my abdomen.  Also,  have a weird feeling and a lot of stomach pain.  The nausea is so bad it prevents me from eating.  I can not stand the smell of food right now which is not good for my diabetes.  I am also very sensitive to oral diabetic medication and was wondering if my doctor should have prescribed this.  I am not overweight so I do not need this for weight loss,  only sugar level control.  I will not advance to the 0. 5 doses.  As a matter of fact,  I am stopping this medicine altogether.  I cannot continue to take medicine that is supposed to help but make me so sick. ",Ozempic

My a1c is the same as when I was taking 2000mg Metformin daily 5. 1 5. 3.  My Dr decided to switch me to help with weight loss and manage my pre diabetes.  
I have lost 47lbs,  which is great but it isn not a healthy way to lose weight.  I met with a GI specialist and was diagnosed with Gastroparesis,  they had me discontinue Ozempic to see if my symptoms would disappear.  That was 6 weeks ago and my stomach is still paralyzed.  I have sulphur burps,  diarrhoea,  severe constipation and vomiting daily.  I now have to eat a low FODMAP diet and can only manage a few mouthfuls of food at a time.  I have no quality of life anymore,  I can no longer enjoy many of the things I used to which has caused me severe anxiety and depression. 
While the weight loss benefits sound appealing,  please think twice before taking this drug. ",Ozempic
"I have type 2 diabetes and my doctor put me on Ozempic.  Be very careful before taking this medication.  I got so sick I ended up at the ER.  Within 3 days,  I lost almost 10 lbs.  What they fail to tell you is that this stuff shuts your stomach down one out of 6 people get very sick from it.  Never again. ",Ozempic
So far I love the results my A1C of 9. 8  and now it is 5. 6.   From Aug 2020 to now I lost 67 lbs with diet and working out  from the first week.  I had a head ache but after nothing but positive results from low blood sugars ranging from 80 to 110.  I kept checking I thought it was wrong lol but overall I tell everyone that is type 2 to speak to there doctor and see if it works for them. . . . . . ,Ozempic
"Freedom!  Freedom from the constant foodsugar cravings that ruled my days.  Im starting week 2 and have felt a bit of Sour stomach but to be honest,  less uncomfortable than overeating or indulging in   Fast foodsugary foods that we stuff ourselves with.  The most I felt was after eating ice cream.  Well,  of course!  This truly regulates numbers and totally takes away appetite.  My meals are very small,  clean,  nutrient dense taken to refuel my body,  rather than to seek pleasuresoothe insert and bad feeling.  Go figure   kind of how we are designed to eat?  The best thing?  Carrying out my day feeling lighter and awake   vs.  full and puffy.  Amazing. ",Ozempic
2nd week.   No negative side effects!   Has been life changing.  I used to be dictated by severe hunger pains every 3 hours.   Even middle of night resulting in poor sleep and living to get rid of the pain.   Ozempic has taken that away.   I feel like a normal person.   Not too mention my blood sugar is in the normal range most days!   Love it! ,Ozempic

"I started taking the Ozempic injection a week before Christmas,  and took my second 0. 25 dose on xmas eve.  Ive felt slight nausea since taking it and very little desire to eat.  My BS levels have been 95 in range ever since and have managed to reduce my long acting insulin by 20 units. 
I have lost 6lbs so far I was astounded it came off in the first week.  
The only time I have had bad stomach pains is when I have eaten something bad and I get terrible runs 20 mins after eating,  but once I have been to loo pain stops. 
I had vomiting once because I think I over ate a few days after taking it.   I was super bloated and a few hours later I threw up then I felt fine again.  So I just eat little and often,  mostly grazing and picking at fruit. 
I was worried about taking this because of the comments I have read and with having IBS I didn not know if it would be bad for me.  
But I have no issues taking it and so far so good.  Its still early days for me but I would 100 recommend it. ",Ozempic
"I have started this medication just a few weeks ago and I am quite happy with the lack of side effects so far.  I have taken Trulicity for a number of years,  it is in the same family of medications and if I could share one thing is that with these medications,  for the first 2 3 days after you do your injection if you have a fatty diet at all in that time you get the nausea etc.  If you stay away from fats in that time frame it seems to keep that at bay.

"My dr put me on Ozempic to lower my blood sugar  A1c as everytime I check my blood sugar its extremely high in the 2  300s.  So that is why my dr put my on Ozempic.  The beginning of the year before the med my A1c was 10. 8 my blood sugar was in the 200s.  Its  5 weeks later I went to the dr this week got my sugar checked it was 72 I couldnt believe it plus my A1c is 8. 2  I lost 5lbs,  in just a short period.  I take my shot every Sunday . 25 the day after I take the shot I do experience some nausea headaches  constipation but its only for 1 day but its worth it for these low numbers.  I was scared to take this new drug because I already take metformin 1000mg once a day but Im so happy my dr introduced me to this medicine.

"Was taking trulicity until 2 weeks ago my VA hospital said they need to switch me to ozempic.  I agreed.  Took my first dose 2 days ago after I was out of trulicity and I don not remember a time in my life I felt so sick.

"I currently take 1000 mg of Metformin twice a day,  Lantus at night,  and Humalog before I eat a meal and snacks.  I started taking 0. 25 mg of Ozempic on 01032020.  By the first evening,  I was cramped up so bad,  I didnt want to eat or move.  This really didnt change for 3 weeks.  At that time I called my Doctor and told her what I had experienced  then we moved to 0. 5 mg.  All I can tell you is that I have been miserable since starting to take this drug.  Excessive gas in my stomach that leads to bloating,  abdominal discomfort,  and waking up every 1 or 2 hours to belch away the gas.  OMG the smell of the gas from my stomach could wake the dead and that terrible taste I have in my mouth most of the time.  I will find out about A1C in the coming weeks.

"Have been on this med for about 6 weeks.  Started at . 25 now at 1mg.  I have to say I am loving my numbers now.  Have lost 12 lbs,  and the only side effect is mild stomach cramps occasionally and a slight headache.  I only hope the trend continues,  since some posts have me concerned. ",Ozempic
"I was doing okay at the beginning but when the dose increased at about the one month mark,  I experienced severe stomach and indigestion problems.  I went to the emergency,  and the doctor recommended that I not double the dose but remain at the initial dose.  I did that for about 6 months.  Then I developed major stomach pain,  indigestion,  and constipation.  I went to the emergency again and was given medication as I did at my initial hospitalization.  I have now stopped taking Ozempic because it does not work for me,  and there are too many severe side effects.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone due to my own personal experience from using it for 6 months. ",Ozempic
"Ozempic is DANGEROUS! ! !   I started to get unbearable stomach pains,  bloating,  diarrhea,  increased heart rate,  increased blood pressure,  and a host of other problems.   It got to the point where if I really had to go to the bathroom,  I almost couldn not hold my stool because it was frequent urgent  diarrhea.     I suffered through a nightmare.   One day I went to visit NY and I forgot to take my shot of Ozempic.   My symptoms ALL disappeared after a few days.   OZEMPIC was the culprit.   My blood pressure,  heart rate and everything else went back to normal.   I was so happy and felt great again.  Doctors ARE NOT GOD.   My doctor gave me the Ozempic even though he knew my insurance didn not cover it and it would cost over 550month.   He kept giving me the free samples so I wouldn not have to pay.   What kind of doctor puts you on a long term med knowing you can never afford it?  Bottom line is. . . .  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.   YOU'LL REGRET IT. ",Ozempic
"I only did 2 lowest dose injections and stopped.   The side effects were awful and still linger.   The worst thing about the medication has been the gas,  bloating,  diarrhea and awful tastesmell when I burp.   Im 6 days in after my last injection and I still have all symptoms and continued diarrhea. ",Ozempic
"Well so far my experience with Ozempic has not been great.   I started out using the 0. 25mg and never had any nausea at all,  no lethargy. . . nothing.   My doctor then suggested I increase my dosage to 1mg and that for me was a HUGE mistake.  I have kidney issues and I began noticing that I was having to urinate less and less frequently,  not to mention the constant nausea and extreme lethargy.   I felt awful and decided not to do this medication any longer,  since quitting I feel 100 better,  my energy has come back with regular trips to the bathroom now.   I would rather have my sugar be a little elevated than wind up on dialysis.  For everyone that is on this medication,  I wish you best of luck and I hope this helps your sugar levels,  it just wasn not meant for me. ",Ozempic

Ive been taking it since May 20th so its been around 2 months.  I have some nausea once in awhile but nothing to bad.  My morning sugars have been great also.  Right now

I have had one bout of diarrhea but that was in the first 3 days of use and when I took 2 in the AM versus 1 with each meal.   I do think I need to drink more water with this prescription as it seems to slow bowel movements down.

A blood pressure pill was added to protect the kidneys.  The past summer my husband joined me on the keto lifestyle as well as intermittent fasting.  He  went off all med  the doctor knew.  His glucose readings were great.  But the doctor told him that he wanted him to get back on metformin because the latest research showed that it can extend one is life and is good for the heart.  My husband did not want to do this but I pushed and he started back on it.  Well almost immediately his blood sugar spiked into the low 200 is then mid 200 is.

I find that I now have motion sickness and since I take public transport,  I sometimes have to get off the bus to vomit.  I always have diarrhea.  I sometimes have fever symptoms,  chills along with a feeling of being very cold,  and terrible headaches.  I have also become quite anxious,  restless,  and moody,  which may be a side effect of these side effects.  I have lost 12lbs and I find myself eating less which is awesome but I am ALWAYS nauseous,  which is why I have no appetite. ",Metformin
"An excellent medicine.   I had hyperinsulinemia and was consuming vast amounts of sugar daily to keep my sugar from dropping,  then suddenly my sugar readings became higher and higher every morning.   Diagnosed with diabetes.   Was given Metformin,  no more carbsugar cravings,  no more lows and highs,  I have been taking it for 5 weeks and I have lost 15lbs.   I had ZERO side effects.   I feel GREAT! ",Metformin
"This drug can kill you.   One of the worst reactions to a medication that I have ever experienced.   Last Saturday,  I could hardly walk out of a store as the muscle contractions grew worse and the pressure in my chest increased.   And ER visit followed and a week later,  I am still weak.   It did not get out of my system in 24,  48 nor 72 hours.   Watch this drug closely when you are given it for treatment,  especially if you have already had physical symptoms that are similar to some of its side effects.   And yes,  I had the diarrhea,  the spasms which ran up into my torso and the nausea but I tried working through it all.   I could barely lift my arms last Saturday and I was in pain from my feet to the top of my head.   There was no comfortable place",Metformin
"I was dignosed with prediabetes about a month ago.  Not sure how its helping my blood sugar bcause i havent been rechecked yet,  but i have not had any bd side effects at all and have lost 5 lbs.

"Glucophage XR metformin 							I have been taking glucophage ER for 4 weeks.   The first couple of weeks it made me very sick.   I was told this was normal and to try to hold out and the side effects would stop.   They seemed to and then the dose was increased and I am sick again.   It works really well to get my sugar down.   Before I started  it was an average of 146 or 6. 7 for A1C
Now the average is 101.   Since it is working I am going to hold on for a few more weeks.   I have been told that some people get used to it much faster than I have and some people take a few months. ",Metformin
"I have been using Metformin for 3 months to aggressively treat my pre diabetic condition.   Together with a lower carb 185 200 mg per day1700 calories I have lost 29 pounds.   This  is about double the weight loss rate I had on the diet alone.   The only side effect I have experienced is a loose stool once or twice a week.   Definitely a good trade off!  I am a 49 year old female,  moderately active who has had a hysterectomy. ",Metformin
Metformin was recently added to my Type 2 Diabetes Meds .  I take 2000 mgs a day in divided doses with each meal.  It is rough on the Stomach for sure .  I am 62.  Seems to keep my sugar levels well controlled and it helps you loose weight.   Get some Zofran from your Doctor to help with the nausea .  Will update my experience in a few months.  God Bless . ,Metformin
"I am on slow release metformin 1500 mg,   since changing away from the regular type, 12 years ago I have zero loose bowels.  You must insist to have a chance to try this much better version,  if frequently bothered by the standard pills.  Even more important,  Please look up this fairly obscure nutritional cap. . . PTEROSTILBENE.  It has proven to be a near miracle to free me from diabetes symptoms.  I still take metformin,   only a doctor call put you on that med.  But it works pretty darn well. . . but if you take METF along with PTEROSTILBENE,  diabetes is largely controlled.  Almost like a true cure. . . except you have to continue both.  Pterostibene is found in the skin of blueberries,  and a few other plant sources.  I take 2 50mg caps, daily.  Morn.  night",Metformin

Have a new Endocrinologist and he recommended metformin ER,  and after two days I no longer experience the stomach upset.   Overall very happy with the medication. ",Metformin
"I have found this medicine for type 2 to work extremely well.   I have had to use many other meds for my type 2 diabetes and found myself on one heck of a roller coaster ride with high and low and no middle ground.   This particular med is great for me,  and it helps keep my appetite in control.   The apeptite issue is from another med,  that I will not mention",Metformin
"I am actually pre diabetic.  I have been on this drug for 3 weeks.   I have lost 9 pounds.   Saw my doctor today because things taste very salty to me.

"Glucophage metformin 							I had diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting,  headaches and muscle pain.  It did not control my blood sugar either.  I never want to feel like that again.  But on the other hand my husband is able to take it with no side effects and it keeps his blood sugar between 90 and 130. ",Metformin
"Glucophage metformin 							I consider Glucophage a successful treatment because it has been prescribed to me for ten years and I have had no adverse effects at all.   Aside from favorable blood sugar results,  I don not even feel the drug is in my system. ",Metformin
"I started taking the immediate release version about 3 weeks ago.  My doctor started me on it because I have been pre diabetic for 10 years,  to prevent diabetes.  I take 500 MG 1x daily at night with dinner.  I have had no significant side effects other than a mildly headache about 30 minutes after I take it,  but it goes away on its own.  I crush it and put it in milk or juice.  I am also doing weight watchers app and exercising 6 days a week.  It definitely curbs my appetite.  My weight went from 213 lbs to 204 lbs so far I hope it keeps going down!  We will see if my A1C and blood sugar levels are going down at my Spring physical exam.  I have tried every weight loss program there is.  This time I feel like it is sustainable.  I feel good,  have more energy,  eat well and I don not have to starve or obsess about eating.  The medication definitely takes the edge off and is helping me lose weight and be healthier. ",Metformin

"It took 1000mg twice a day to knock my sugars down about 100 points,  A1C of 10 to around 7 in a few months.  Probably would have done better with other lifestyle changes.   I would actually rate metformin a dang good laxative more than a diabetic med,  but ahh well.  I got used to it,  and that side effect helped me eat less. ",Metformin
"I was prescribed metformin 500mg twice a day.  After a week I looked nine months pregnant from bloating.  Also experienced flu like symptoms lower intestinal cramping,  low backache,  stomach pain,  fatigue,   generally feeling bad,  low energy.  I  quit and went on to try other drugs but could only tolerate Januvia,  with moderate success now insurance won not  cover it and I am on Basaglar insulin  with the only side effect of  weight retentionalmost impossible  to  lose.  

I am so annoyed  that doctors,  nurse practicioners and pharmacists pump up all these drugs and how great they are without  telling you  about  side effects,  then show no empathy to your when you tell them you are having them.  One provider even asked if I  was imagining side  effects! ",Metformin
My mother is on this drug and it has done wonders for her.  Her insulin is controlled and she has lost a significant amount of weight on it.  She is so happy and feels amazing on it.  No negative side effects.  Thank you makers of metformin.  The doctor who prescribed it was so knowledgeable and he really helped my mom adjust and overcome the diagnosis. ,Metformin
"Been taking Metformin for type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years.   Over the last five years my memory has gotten so bad that I almost can not function at work,  I am dizzy,  anxious,  cold,  and often confused.   My doctor said it was not due to the Metformin.   I lowered my dose myself and the coldness stopped and other symptoms improved slightly.   A year later they were even worse.   I cut my pills in half to reduce my dose again,  and most of the symptoms went away.   Now that I have been on this reduced dose a while,  the symptoms are slowly coming back.   I won not be taking Metformin any more.   It is a terrible way to live not ring able to remember what someone just said to you,  where you left off counting,  or how to get to the store.

"From the get go I had stomach pain,  severe nausea,  diarrhea and I was on 500mg a day.  After a month of feeling miserable I quit taking it.  I reversed my diabetes through a ketovore diet and walking.  A1c went from 7 to 5. 4 in three months. ",Metformin
"I take 500 mg twice daily.   Initial gastric symptoms passed quickly.   No help in weight loss.   Some help in lowering blood sugar.   Main side effect is extreme tiredness and fatigue.   Never feel like exercising.   Stopped taking metformin a few times due to fatigue,  but when sugar levels escalated to higher than before starting it,  I got back on it and just put up with the tiredness.  ",Metformin
"On Metformin near two years.  In Canadian terms my blood sugar is in the fives,  this am 5. 1.  I take 500mg per day and have lost about 25 lbs since being diagnosed.  Now I believe that comes from  the pill,  daily gym sessions and a drastically changed diet.  A hamburger bun is now a piece of lettuce,  spaghetti now comes from zuchiinni,  mashed potatoes are now mashed cauliflower and fiber based cereal is pretty normal for breakfast. ",Metformin
"When I was first diagnosed,  my doctor gave me Metformin.  After I took the very first pill,  I had SEVERE stomach pain,  nausea,  and vomiting.  I spent hours curled up in the fetal position balling my eyes out.  I didn not care if it took time to adjust to the side effects.  I tried one day is worth of the medicine and tossed the rest.  My doctor went on to prescribe Amaryl. 

I am sure Metformin is a great drug for some people,  as it works well for other family members,  but the stomach pain and vomiting was too much to handle.  No thanks. ",Metformin
"Worked ok but horrible GI side effects and weight gain.   Hours after taking it in the morning I had the feeling of a bowling ball in my stomach,  sometimes accompanied by cramping.   In the 3 months I took it I gained 20 Lbs which came off when discontinued.  I know this is the most popular med for type 2 but the side effects are worse than the symptoms. ",Metformin

I noticed my heart was racing,  sometimes at 90 beats a minute.   My heart had NEVER done that,  as I am in excellent shape,  a power walkerjogger.  I knew that the metformin caused it because as I sat with wife over supper,  I took the 500mg pill half way through the meal.  Within a few minutes my heart was pounding almost out of control.  My blood pressure monitor showed normal blood pressure,  but a pulse of 101.  I stopped the drug right away.  The problem is that it takes 4 days for this damn drug is effects to leave the body.

I have been on Metformin since I was about 10 years old.  I am 27 now,  it always worked well for me.  But I had been off it for a long time due to insurance and income issues.  It never caused this explosive diarrhea back in the early 2000s!  Thankfully that side effect has subsided.  

I learned from some Cysters' pcos sisters to take Metformin late at night,  in the middle of a full meal and drink a full glass of water.  Imodium also helps,  but I hardly even have to take that now.  

So it lowers my A1C,  aided in weight loss,  gave me my cycle back and helped with the facial hair some.  I take the 1000mg once a day.

No gain or loss in weight on this drug.  I am not fat.  I do crave carbohydrates on it though.  My A1C usually is in the six is most of the time.  I have it checked every three months.  I was fighting this disease on my own,  but for me I gave up after three years because I was very limited to what I could eat.  I was diagnosed 4 years ago with a starting A1C of 13.  Got it down to 8 with no medicines,  but that is when I gave up because the life style is just not conducive to normal life.  ",Metformin

No issues with metaformin at all no side effects.  On 500mg twice daily for t2 diabetes  it is lowering my blood sugar it does work.

"I was found to have type 2 diabetes early in pregnancy.  I was previously on a low carb diet that had worked well for me but was advised by my diabetes clinic to increase carbs and whole grains because it would benefit the baby.  As soon as I began eating bread,  rice and pasta I began to swell up and started having headaches.  I was given a glucose test which was very high and my Doctor was preparing to put me on insulin.  I was convinced that it was the high intake of sugar carbs that had got me into this situation so asked for a week to try and sort it out myself.  I cut down on carbs and I improved within 2 days.

They tried to also put me on insulin and I told them to kick rocks.  3 months later 2 days ago my A1C is down to 6. 7!  Down 4. 5 points!  I am hoping in 3 more months I can get it down to 5. 5.

I have been on metformin 500mg once a day for 3 mo.   At first it was great I even lost a little weight.   My A1C went up recently and I gained the weight back.   I believe that was due to extreme stress.   My doc increased my dosage to twice a day now.   I have not had many side effects just headaches no stomach issues.   I hope it helps me as I am afraid to go too high on the dosage because of the recall issues.   I am hoping the benefits outweigh the risk. ,Metformin

She start hallucinating again.  Once again I asked the charge nurse what had caused her to start hallucinating again.   Charge nurse told me,  POA for

When my PCP moved away,  I had to find a new one.  My new PCP switched me from glipizide to metformin.  As much as I tried to carefully titrate on to the medicine,  metformin left me feeling bloated and with chronic diarrhea.  My body simply would not tolerate metformin.  I ended up seeing an endocrinologist,  and he switched me to insulin,  and I am VERY happy with that move.  My glucose levels are under control,  and I don not have to deal with any adverse effects.

Januvia is not a bad drug,  it is just a useless drug IMHO. 
It actually raised my A1C a little until I stopped taking it.   The side effects for me was runny nose and some chest congestion which was ok if it did anything.  Then I did some research which prompted me to stop taking it.  I am not even going into how expensive it was,  as if it did anything I would be happy to take it but it didn not.  
But lets look at the actual clinical trials.  
Januvia reduces A1c by . 8 percent or less than 1 percent.  What does that actually mean?  If you have an A1C of 7. 5 before Januvia,  expect 7. 44 after taking Januvia.  Not impressive at all considering the cost and minor side effects. ",Sitagliptin

Since taking this medicine,  I have heartburn and indigestion My sleeping habits have changed,  because of the constant stomach churning and it has been keeping me up.

Woke up again it spread to my right side.   Found out it swollen up my lymph nodes.   Painful.   My body ended up so sore and I was really tired.  Please don not take this medication.   I would rather deal with metformin after this. ",Sitagliptin
"If I would be more compliant with my diet and exercise regimen,  Januvia would help me stay under 6.   No noticeable side effects,  although after reading other reviews,  possibly the lack of sleep might be attributed to it.   I had some joint pain but I take CoQ10 and that made it go away.   Not sure if that was from Januvia or the statins.   Overall,  I like it.   Can not wait until,  with better compliance,  I can come off these costly medicines. ",Sitagliptin
"After seeing my doctor,  he took me off the Metformin ER 500 mg,  because it wasn not helping me.  Therefore,  he gave me a sample box of Januvia 100 mg to try out.  I had the worst experience ever.  After 2 days of taking this medicine I began having severe pains in my stomach,  back and legs to the point I couldn not walk.  The pain was intense,  excruciating,  agonizing.  I discontinued the medicine after the second day I have another doctor appointment and I will be sure to address this issue.

After 2. 5 wks,  I told him I was experiencing facial  hand  eye lid swelling and told him I felt this wasn not a good fit for me.   So,  he prescribed Januvia 50mg,  which after three days,  caused nausea,  upper abdominal pain,  orange urine,  and skyrocketing BG from low 120 is to well over 200 is after eating.   I immediately quit taking it. ",Sitagliptin
"Metformin and Glipizide weren not working well enough to keep my blood sugar in control.  My doctor added Starlix at meals and that seemed to help some but still didn not produce the desired results.  As a last resort to beginning insulin,  he prescribed Januvia.  Wow!  What a difference.  My morning readings dropped from the 170s into the 80 90 range within a week or two.  Only negative side effect is occasional constipation,  but nothing I can not deal with.  Have been taking Januvia for about four months and one positive benefit I have noticed is a decrease in cravings or appetite in the evenings the worst time of the day for me. ",Sitagliptin
"No noticeable difference with Januvia,  which was added to Metformin,  Glipizide,  and now Victoza.  I have been taking the first three meds for a few years.   My question is that I often see the entire Januvia pill,  undigested,  in my stool.   Why is this?   I tend to be constipated but do not take laxatives.   I told my doctor,  but she did not seem concerned.   If this med is just passing through my body,  what is the point?   I take my Januvia,  and Glipizide before dinner,  and my Metformin before breakfast and my night time snack.   I have high morning sugars. ",Sitagliptin
"2 wks ago my left ear felt like it has water in it.  Like after swimming  have swooshing sound in your ear til it comes out.  After 2nd day I knew it wasnt water.  Just annoying,  not painful,  so I knew it wasnt an ear infection.  After a week I began to get bothered since it hadnt gone away  decided to go to urgent care.  Dr said nothing there no wax build up,  fluid,  or infection.  Told me to tug on my ear  if still there after 2 wks call my GP for ENT referral.  A week later I noticed hearing loss so decided to call GP  get referral.  Today Ive been thinking what have I done different that could have caused this?  I have never had ear issues.  In 44 years I have had 2 year infections  I swam almost daily in college.  After thinking about it on  off today something finally went off in my brain that reminded me of my newest Rx Januvia.  Stopped taking it today.  Now Im praying damage is reversable.  Very disappointed my Google search answered my suspicions  2 Drs couldnt.   Side effect  ear congestion. ",Sitagliptin
"Hi I took Januvia for approximately 6 weeks.  As time went on I started to feel stiffness in my right shoulder  I thought nothing of it.  Then my neck started stiffening up to the point I could barely drive and at night if I laid on my back I started to wake up through the night it felt like my breathing was cut off,  and still I never thought it might be Junuvia . I was taking 50mg in morning with my metformin then it was like my joints In my foot stiffened to the point I could not walk. I  called my doctor she told me to stop taking it right away I am well now but it to me 7 weeks to recover from the stiffness",Sitagliptin

"The side effects of 50 mg Januvia with Metformin ER were horrendous.  Painful finger joints.  Swelling fingers.  Stuffy ears.  Unbelievable dizziness which caused nausea and dry heaves.  The diarrhea has been so awful that I can not leave home.  I stopped the Januvia 4 days ago.  The dizziness stopped fist.  Then my hands settled down.  The diarrhea has not stopped.  My DR believes that I have parasites because Januvia,  in conjunction with Metformin ER,  doesn not cause diarrhea like this.  Getting tested tomorrow AND I have to go back on Januvia.  Not looking forward to this at all.  What a mess. ",Sitagliptin
"Januvia caused me severe muscle cramps,  bad enough that I should have gone to the hospital because of the pain.  I also got where I could not sleep at night while on januvia.  It was also not effective for me.  I was placed on Invokana in addition.  I am still having side effects after stopping both of these.  My doctor did not even bother to return my call when I took my self off of Januvia.  Because the spasms are in my neck shoulder area,  it has caused me to drop 40 pounds off of my weight lifting work out.  This is not good.  I would encourage anyone considering Januvia or Invokana to do research on the side effects because my side effects were not common,  but the drug company lied to doctors about all of the side effects.

I was supposed to be taking regular insulin but I am unable to be compliant so my doctor suggested this as something to try to bring my sugar down at least a little.   To my surprise it is working very well. ,Sitagliptin
"Warning!  If you value your eyesight you will not take this drug!  I have been considered diabetic for over 8 years now and was on 4 mg of Amryl daily.  I went to doctor for routine bloodwork and found that my A1C had increased so I was prescribed Januvia.  After taking this drug for 3 days I became very nearsighted even with my glasses on.  I have not had a vision change in over 30 years even when at times my blood sugar had gotten high.  I immediately realized that the onset correlated with when I started taking Januvia.  I went to the optometrist and confirmed what was true,  that Januvia had caused this.  I quit taking it with the hope that my eyesight would correct itself once the drug was out of my system.  3 months later my eyesight is no better.  I truly believe this medication destroyed my eyesight and I would sue the company if knew I could win,  but I know this would be blamed on blood sugar level fluctuating.  I know my own body and I know what really happened. ",Sitagliptin
"Worst medication I have ever taken so far.   
My insurance,  like most people limits what I am  allowed  to take to stay alive,  well this almost finished me off.     
My blood sugar spiked from 250 on no meds,  to 500 on Januvia,  I broke out in hives and had flu like symptoms.  I actually dragged myself in for a covid test thinking I had gotten sick.    
After missing a dose do to my ill health,  I noticed my symptoms started to decrease and my blood sugar started going down.  As soon as I went back on it,  everything returned.    
NEVER AGAIN! ! ! ",Sitagliptin
"Been taking januvia for 7 months,  blood glucose was 26,  I take 1000 metformin ay night,  34 units of insulin in the morning with januvia.  With exercise my blood glucose is now between 4. 4 and 7. 8.  4. 4 if I exercise but goes up once I eat.  My joint pain side effects is excruciating at night.  In shins,  knee,  fingers.  I have ceased taking januvia a few times for 4 days to a wek and the joint pain stopped but I always continued.  It has helped my swollen legs and helped me in other ways.   My joint pain is terrible tonight.  I rub peppermint oil on my legs or difflam cream and take paracetamol rapid.  Sometimes it doesn not help so I cease taking the tablet to stop the pain only for a few days.  I take metamucil for the runs and cut back on veggies and eat superfoods instead. ",Sitagliptin
"I was on Metformin 1000mg a day , and I began to have severe diarrhea,  but my blood sugar BS was under control.  My Dr.  took me off of Metformin and put me on Januvia 100mg a day,  now my BS has increased.  I informed her and now Im being prescribed glipizide starting today.  So we will see what happens.

"I was taking 25mg Januvia  twice per day for about 3 months.   I just tapered off about one month ago and will NOT use it again.    I experienced increased hunger  a known side effect   and gained 12 pounds or more in 3 months.   I stopped using it about a month ago and have already lost about 9 pounds,  with no change in diet or exercise.    I was suspicious all along it was this drug causing the weight gain  because nothing else had changed with my diet or exercise.   Also,  the drug made very little difference to my daily glucose levels,  which I check several times daily.    Not worth the risks or the cost.   I am sticking to metformin which has done wonders for me. ",Sitagliptin
"After 1 and a half months on Januvia I started feeling real bad like my hormones was all out of place I told my doctor and she told me to stay on Januvia so I did for 3 and a half months and so contacted her again with my weight dropping like crazy and feeling very petite I had no appetite I made myself eat than I started googling this drugs and now I feel like I am going crazy.  Now my doctor want see me until January of next year I have been to the ER and urgent care they run all kind of blood work and said everything looks good my heart is racing even when I am resting,  so ER say I have to let it run it is course until it is out my system.  I will never take this drug ever again and it didn not make a difference in my A1C.  I am feeling real bad now but what can I do if there is anyone out there that can answer me or what can I do please let me know thanks",Sitagliptin
"Januvia only worked for me for a few months.    I would take it with a small breakfast.   It would help a little with high glucose at that meal.    The rest of the day the glucose would get high at every meal.   I am disgusted with Januvia.    Actually I am disgusted with doctors.    I also take insulin once a day,  as I don not make enough of my own. ",Sitagliptin

Over 200 daily average I test 7 timesday.  Morning Fasting went from 115 to 226.  Nine hours of vomiting and diarhhea on second day.  Nauseous every day for two weeks.  Lost 5 lbs in two weeks  I need to gain weight.  Stopped after day 14.  Very bad drug for me.  Dr now wants me to try another miracle drug Farxiga.  Don not think so as I will need a loan just to buy it. ",Sitagliptin

"This drug almost killed me.  Was only in for 12 weeks before I experienced sudden severe weakness,  severe dry mouth,  dizziness,  could barely walk,  migraine headaches and severe upper left stomach pain.  Thank god I had read possible side effects so I stopped immediately and felt better within days.  Now Im having my kidneys and pancreas checked for damage. . ",Sitagliptin
"This was a disaster.  I had severe diarrhea.  Within 3 days I lost 15 pounds.  Unfortunately,  this dehydrated my cranky old body badly enough that I nearly fell getting out of bed,  and was unable to stand.  I spent 7 days in a hospital.  The next week I spent fighting two infections that I picked up in the hospital. ",Sitagliptin
"While taking Januvia I suffered from severe incontinence with my bladder completely emptying while walking to the bathroom.  I also had perineal itching and spontaneous boils. 
Worked very well at lowering my blood sugar levels,  but not willing to destroy my quality of life. ",Sitagliptin
"I have been using metformin twice a day for years but developed diarrhea.  The doctor changed me to one metformin in the morning and one Januvia in the evening.  The diarrhea was controlled,  but I feel Januvia is way too expensive at 200.  I will stop using it and ask the doctor for alternatives. ",Sitagliptin
"Januvia had been part of my treatment routine since last year and seemed to be doing the job,  along with Glyclacide sp and  Jardiance,  until last weekend.  After 3 days and 2 nights of extreme vomiting,  I finally took an ambulance to the hospital.  After a variety of tests,  it was discovered that the Januvia brought about ketoacidosis.  I have been advised that while this is not a usual side effect,  it meant I could no longer take the medication. ",Sitagliptin
I know it says Januvia can cause weight gain but in the 3 4 months Ive been on it its been getting rid of my appetite where I have none basically.  Ive lost over 20lbs on it so far and I take it with Jardiance and Metformin!  Diabetic type 2 for 22 years,Sitagliptin
"This was the best medication for my 76 year old mother on a fixed social security income of 974 a month but because of her age and being on medicare this company offers no help which is part of the sad world we live in.  Why would a company have a medicine that works,  but people can not afford? ? ? ",Sitagliptin
"Jardiance  I see ozempic is related to Jardiance.   Jardiance gives me diarrhea,  UTI infections or bladder infections for which the doctor merely increases my prescription,  Jardiance clogs my nose so I can hardly breathe,  Jardiance gives me sensitive skin and sometimes causes a rash like condition,  this is a terrible medication yet the doctor refuses to take me off it.   I take 25 mg of Jardiance once a day.   Combined with Jentadueto I have had no quality of life. ",Sitagliptin
"I have been on Januvia 50mg for a year with Metformin ever since after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 12 years ago. 

I had no side effects from Januvia during much of that time.   It did lower my A1c significantly and reduced my hunger urges.   Several months ago I noticed an increase in diarrhea and more recently I have almost daily gas bloating and stomach aches that affect my sleep.   I cannot account for these symptoms from food as I gave up carbonated and diet drinks to no effect. 

I have contacted my doctor to hopefully find an alternative medication such as Jardiance which may also benefit my congestive heart failure from a heart attack 4 years ago. ",Sitagliptin
"When used with Metformin,  I had stomach pain,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  nausea.  Without Metformin,  I now have a constant backache,  leg swelling,  increased appetite.

"I usually dont share reviews but felt this was warranted.   I took my first 2. 5 mg shot on 94,  felt fine until 97 when the terrible sulfur burps started followed by sour stomach and nausea.   Around 10 pm that night I began 5 days of severe vomiting and diarrhea which culminated yesterday at the ER getting fluids,  CT scans,  and IV nausea meds.   I will not be taking this shot again I have not thrown up anymore but the diarrhea will just not stop.  I cant eat or take any of my other medication properly.   Beware.   When something sounds too good to be true it usually it is.   Im a past user of byetta,  victoza,  ozempic,  trulicity,  rybellsus,  bydureon,  all the pills,  and and about every homeopathic treatment ever made.   I didnt take this shot like a blind fool but I have never had a side effect as terrible as this case.     Ill stick with my insulin.  At least I can function like a normal human being! ",Mounjaro 
"I started with this medication for weight loss and since I am 58 and a diabetic,  my insurance covered it.   It is a fantastic weight loss drug for me.   Starting at 5'6 242lbs.  I have lost 23 pounds in 12 weeks.  I don not remember when I was able to lose this much weight.   I have dieted my whole life and finally gave up and ballooned to 242lb.   You have to be careful about eating greasy food and to not over eat.   I did vomit a few times after eating greasy food.   Other than that,  I am so excited.   My first goal is to get to 180 and see what happens.   My feet no longer hurt when I stand all shift. ",Mounjaro 
"This is my 2nd time posting.   Was on Trulicity in the past  now Mounjaro 5mg,  7. 5mg  bumped to 12. 5.   Effects for me are minimal  not bad,  at all.   Some days the acid reflux or constipation is bad,  but it is not way off the charts  is manageable.   One thing I noticed,  as my doctor progressed me up the ladder to higher doses of Mounjaro. . . the weight loss is amp'ing up.   Gradually starting to lose more per week than when on lower doses.   Also,  on 5 mg  7. 5mg,  I noticed on days 1 4,  I wasn not hungry AT ALL  knew that I needed to eat therefore,  I thought of food as FUEL,  not just tasty  I made betterhealthier choices.   Now,  on 12. 5mg,  I find days 1 5 or 6. . . . I am not hungry at all  still making better food choices,  because I have to make myself eat.   The in between meals snacking has totally GONE AWAY.   This drug has been a miracle for me,  as my Thyroid Hashimoto is has caused so much weight gain wthe slower metabolism  I couldn not lose any weight until Mounjaro.   It is a blessing! ",Mounjaro 
I was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss.  I took my first 2. 5mg dose on Friday 916.  Today is Sunday two days later and I have yet to feel anything different.  I dont feel full and theres no lack of desire to eat.  I feel the same as I always have.  I wonder if I did the shot right.  I dont know maybe it takes a moment to kick in.  I see people saying they lost weight in the first week Im not sure how thats possible if I dont have appetite suppression.  I guess time will tell. ,Mounjaro 
"I was on Mounjaro for 2 months.  I had side effects of lower back pain,  increased thirst and decreased urine output.  I increased my fluid intake.  Cut out all sugary drinks and foods.  Barely could eat.  I was on 5 mg.  I woke 1162023 vomiting black coffee like grounds.  Go to the ER that afternoon and was admitted.  After many labs scans I found out my liver was in shock.  All liver enzymes were elevated.  I am talking 1100 numbers elevated from what the normal is 40 ish.  My liver was on the way to shutting down.  My body was shutting down.  GI BLEED as well.  Do not take this medication.  There is not enough information! ! ! ",Mounjaro 
"I completed 4 weeks on 2. 5 mg with zero side effects,  other than the intended appetite suppression and lost 10 pounds.  HOWEVER after my second week at 5mg I am not sure I can continue,  I have had awful nausea,  vomiting,  sulfur burps,  and diarrhea,  to the point I had to go to the ER for IV fluids and potassium.  Zofran,  Phenegran,  Tums and Pepto have zero effect.  I can barely function,  but hey,  I am down a total of 17lbs in 6 weeks,  so at least I will look skinny for my next trip to the ER.

"Started on 2. 5 mg 3 weeks ago.  Im 52 and starting weight was 175. 4,  my highest was 180.  I decided to try medication  after my waist was 39 inches. 
 After my 3rd injection,  I am now 165 and lost 3 inches off my waist .  This is with minimal exercise and mostly appetite suppression.  Bacon and eggs that I have eaten faithfully as part of an attempt at the keto diet,  I just cant eat.  Food is unappealing.  Ive struggled 2x this week to reach 1200 calories.  That has never happened to me before.  
Side effects indigestion,  fatigue

Hoping this continues to work with minimal adverse events.  Ive been gaining losing the same 3 5 pounds since my daughters birth 5 years ago.  This makes sticking to a meal plan so much easier.  My binge eating during shark week  had gotten out of control.  Id like to add my kettlebell training back,  hoping I get some energy back. ",Mounjaro 
I have had A1C. . 11. . . after two months of using  Mounjaro it is  now 7 and I have been losing 2 or three pounds a week.  A friend took picture of me and I actually saw the weight loss.

"Started taking 2. 5 last Thursday.  Day 1 no side effects,  day 2 mild nausea,  day 3 everything broke loose!  Dizzy spells,  clammy sweats,  severe abdominal pains,  and bloating.

"Started 1026.  Weight 245,  female.  2. 5 1x,  5,  1x,  10mg,  last 2 months.  Current 214.  Zero exercise unfortunately.  I have read so many reviews and I am baffled at all these bad side effects,  since mine were so minor except constipation and tiredness day after injection.  Learned early,  no sugar,  breads,  or pastapotato.  I take no other meds,  do a strict low carb and fast.  I have a protein shake at noon,  a meat and a LC veg for dinner small portion always,  then freeze a protein shake for two hours and it makes ice creamish.  Delish!  Thats all I eat daily.  Hunger is now fully controllable!  My A1C started at 6. 7,  BUT I was on low carb for 6 weeks prior to blood work so likely much higher in general.  Last weeks blood test showed A1C at 5. 0.  My ALT SGPT liver was high last test,  and normal range this time.  What did go up was my top 4 CBC numbers.  Overall,  this is a game changer.  So grateful.  I truly believe eating right is the key when on this med.  Hope this helps someone. ",Mounjaro 
"I am a Type 2 diabetic.  I have been on Mounjaro for several months.  It is controlling my blood sugar great,  and I have lost some weight.  My biggest problem with the Mounjaro is the fact that I cannot get it because of unavailability.  I don not understand how people who want to lose weight take priority over people with a medical condition.  The people with diabetes need this medication and are not able to get their prescriptions filled because the people who want to lose weight are hoarding this medication.  I also want to lose weight,  however,  the control of my blood sugars is a priority to me.  I cannot control my blood sugars without my medication.  Something needs to be done so that diabetics can control the disease.  Obesity is not a disease,  but diabetes is.  Mounjaro is a great medication for type 2 diabetics for controlling their blood sugar.  Availability for diabetics should be a priority. ",Mounjaro 
Im type 2 diabetic and was on Ozempic for quite sometime and having difficulty getting my med.  My doctor changed me to Mounjaro for my diabetes thinking I would be able to get my meds.  I started on the 5mg since I had been on Ozempic.  My side effects were typical slight nausea.   I was trying to get my 2nd month filled and the issues started with availability AGAIN.  The 5mg and 7. 5mg were on backorder.   He increased my dose to 10mg.  I have experienced sulfur burps but that is about it.  I have not seen much weight loss but then again Im more concerned about my diabetes.  Shame on the drug companies for dangling a med that works to lower A1C and cholesterol and choosing to utilize it for weight loss where the insurance wont cover it.  Im not using this med for vanity its for my chronic disease. ,Mounjaro 
"I am a 6'2,  46 year old male who started his journey at 305 lbs.  My doctor prescribed me Mounjaro 10. 0 in Jan.  of 2023.  In Dec.  of 2023,  I went to level 12. 5.  Mounjaro,  along with a balanced diet and exercising 4 5 days a week,  changed my life for the better.  I went from a 'Living to Eat' person to an 'Eating to Live' person.  Mounjaro helps me mentally and physically.  After I eat,  I feel fuller longer,  and I don not get food cravings.  It is amazing! !  I went from 305 lbs to 238 lbs.  That is 67 lbs in 13 14 months.  I am off all insulin.  I stopped snoring at night.  I am participating in 5K races.  Achieving goals and having fun!  Team Gavin,  I treat my body like a football team   Offense   gym four to five days a week,  Defense   portion control,  Special Teams   Mounjaro injections once a week.  I don not think I could be doing this well without all three.  The journey continues for me,  and I hope after you read this,  it begins with you.  Good luck! ",Mounjaro 
"I started Mounjaro to help control my blood sugar.   I had tried Ozempic and Trulicity and could not tolerate the nausea,  sulfur burps and stomach issues.  Mounjaro has been life changing.  No bad side effects.   Im not hungry,  I dont have cravings,  Im losing weight steadily,  and sweet desserts taste too sweet.   Many people say theyve had bad side effects with it.   I say try it as it may work for you.  Just like I couldnt use other meds that other people love.   For me it has been life altering. ",Mounjaro 
I have been on 2. 5 mg for 5 weeks.   My starting weight was 263.   I have lost 15 lbs.  with no side effects.   My doctor has placed me on the 5 mg dosage.   Hopefully I will continue losing weight with no side effects. ,Mounjaro 
"I started taking Mounjaro 91.  This resulted in the very worst month of my life.  WEEK ONE   Super Nauseous,  indigestion,  stomach pain 3 4 days of the first week.  My appetite went from a 10 to a 2.  Which was good WEEK TWO   I had diarrhea for 3 4 days,  along with sulfur belches,  nausea,  stomach pain. . . I ended up having to take sick days and going to get an IV bag to recover from the dehydration.  WEEK THREE   World class nausea and vomiting.  3 days of vomiting so hard that I ruptured my esophagus.   The entire month,  if I was not having diarrhea I was VERY constipated.  I lost 9 lbs in one month,  but I don not know if it was because I could barely eat because of the sickness.  

PASS! ! ",Mounjaro 
Be careful when deciding to take this medication.  I advise you to speak first with your doctor and if you could find another way to lose weight you should decide to go with something else.  The side effects for some people are almost unbearable.  I was 100 healthy before taking this.  Now my blood sugar levels are low I can not wait for this to leave my system.  Its hard to work out I feel awful.  Ever since I stopped taking it since my sugar levels are low I have to eat more sugar and its hard to eat.  I feel nauseous and its so hard to start the day feeling like this.  Please beware I know of people that are not even eating while taking this because they lost their appetite and they have to blend their food because it wont go down.  The side effects at the beginning for many people are really awful.  If you have to work and be productive dont take this medicine you will regret it. ,Mounjaro 
"Female age 56.  Started Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in February 2022.  Start weight was 249 pounds.  Today,  my weight is 162,  down a total of 87 pounds!  No more high blood pressure or high cholesterol.  My lower back pain that prevented me from walking for more than 5 minutes is gone.  I no longer get out of breath just trying to do normal everyday things.  I was very depressed and miserable due to the struggle of trying to live life being so overweight and basically semi handicapped.  I was very introverted and unhappy overall for decades due to being overweight and countless attempts to lose weight and not able to be successful and continued to gain.  Now I can walk for miles on end without any pain.  I can do things I did 25 years ago.  I got my life back.  Wish this drug was around many years ago but better late than never.  I am on a 15mg dosage.  If I get nausea the day after the shot,  I take a couple of tums and its gone.  I take a stool softener to combat hard stools and it does the trick. ",Mounjaro 
"I am 6ft and started at 213lbs.  Blood sugars were a little elevated and I could see they were headed in the wrong direction.  I also have severe sleep apnea.  
I started 7. 5 and just finished my fourth week.   This drug is amazing.  Im down 24 lbs in 28 days.  Lost 4 lbs last week.  Current weight is 189lb.  Goal is 175lb.  I check my blood sugar 2 or 3 times a day.  My highest reading was 101 about an hour after eating.  Most readings in the low 80s which is perfect.   I couldnt have asked for more from this drug.  
Side effects are constipation drink lots of water and tired the day after the shot.  
Ive been slightly overweight my entire life.  I hope to lose this weight and then see if the sleep apnea goes away.   Life changing. ",Mounjaro 
"I am now on the 10 mg dosage.  I was in fear of starting this regimen when my Dr.  suggested it was worth a try.  I finally agreed after months of bad test results on my A1c  liver enzymes.  I did not have the severe side effects that some have experienced.  I felt a little nauseous,  and quickly learned that I had to cut back on my food intake overall,  plus eat less foods that are hard for my body to digest.  I still get some uncomfortable feeling and tiredness about 2 days after the shot.  My A1c and liver enzymes were finally heading in a downtrend at my Dr.  appointment last month. . . the first in over 5 years.  I have lost approximately 21 lbs.  My weight loss is slow but that is fine with me.  I do not know what the future holds but so far this is working. ",Mounjaro 
"Holy side effects.  

First,  if you eat when you take it,  it just sits in your stomach and youll be burping it for 12 hours.  

The headache is insane.  Starts immediately.  

Then you are hit with 3 days of nausea,  fatigue and just overall fatigue.  Just when you start to feel better,  cue the insane heartburn !  

It took me 5 days to feel normal again.  

Ill pass on this even though I lost 5 pounds the first week. ",Mounjaro 
Constant nausea no matter what I eat.  Muscle weakness and tired all the time.  Im feeling mentally down.  Tomorrow will be my 3rd shot and Im seriously hoping these side effects go away so I can get type II diabetes under control.  Probably losing some weight because I dread the nausea after eating so am not eating as much.  The verdict is still out for me on this medicine. ,Mounjaro 
"This is my fifth week and I started on 2. 5mg and now on 5. 0mg,  I have had only one side effect.  Dry mouth but I lost 29lbs the first month.  I weighed 243lbs and now I am down to 214lbs.  If you dont eat fried foods,  sugar,  or heavy carbs,  you will do great.  I dont overeat anymore,  plus exercise I walk 5 miles a day.  I drink at least 64fl oz water.  This medication is worth taking.  I had no issues at all.  And feel great.  I cant wait to fulfill my journey.  The key is to follow a plan.  You want a life change this is it!  I used the coupon and only certain pharmacies know how to code it.  I got lucky because My pharmacy worked with me. ",Mounjaro 
"I saw this medication on TikTok  decided to try it.   Started on 2. 5mg  on 92322 at 204 pounds.   Had some chills  started feeling a little off,  light headed,  metallic taste in mouth,  major loss of appetite,  increased anxiety.  Continued through the 2. 5mg then moved up to 5. 0mg.   On my 4th injection of 5. 0mg my life flipped upside down.  This medication caused me some serious side effects,  syncope,  dehydration,  electrolytes to be out of sync,  chest pain  one heck of panic attack while at work  I had to be rushed to ER.    Very scary  thankful I was not driving when it happened.    I have stopped the medication immediately.   I want to feel normal again.  Down to 190 pounds now not worth the risk. ",Mounjaro 
"This is my 2nd post,  I am on 7. 5 mg of Mounjaro and I have loved every moment of this journey.  I was 243 lbs and lost 49 lbs so far since October 2022.  I also eat a healthy diet and exercise.  Stay hydrated because my side effect is dry mouth and constipation.  I did however find out that if you eat carbs,  sugar,  or fried food you will get nauseous and possibly throw up.  Lesson learned.  Stick to protein and vegetables and fruit.  I need to lose 34 more lbs to be at my ideal weight.  I am still excited to be on this journey. ",Mounjaro 
"I tried Ozempic for 9 weeks and thought I was going to die,  so they switched me to Mounjaro.  The 1st 2 weeks were okay,  I just didn not have an appetite,  but week 3 hit me just like ozempic did.  Total exhaustion,  I have lost 5 lbs in little over 3 days,  
 I have side effects of sulphur burps,  dehydrated,  constant nausea,  falling to sleep at all times,  all night vomiting and diarrhea.  I feel bruised from head to toe and blurred vision.  I am telling people this for a warning.  Read the reviews.  People are constantly going to the ER because of these medications.  I am flustered because I found something that worked for my diabetes,  but  it is really bad for  me.  Since starting Ozempic up to now I have lost almost 30lbs. . .  might sound great but not when you can not function. ",Mounjaro 
"I have been on Mounjaro since March 2023,  it is now February 2024.  When my doctor suggested Mounjaro to me,  I was at a point in my life where I didn not think it could get much worse.  My A1C was off the charts,  I was severely obese at 280 pounds,  and I was scheduling my 6th surgery in 7 months!  Now,  almost a year later,  my diabetes is gone!  I am 100 pounds down to 180 and no more surgeries in my foreseeable future!  Game changer! ",Mounjaro 
"I know this med doesn not work for everyone and some people have some pretty horrific side effects.  Luckily,  I am one of those people who it DOES work for.  In 4 months,  went from A1C of 7. 5 to 5. 0.  All of my other regular labs are in normal range.  Going off atorvastatin 10mg for cholesterol and lisinopril 10mg for high blood pressure soon.  Also,  lost 45 lbs.  Only side effect worth mentioning is constipation,  but I think I finally have a handle on that with magnesium supplement.  Started on 2. 5mg for 8 shots,  5. 0mg the rest of the time.  My biggest problem is supply issues.  I have a prescription for 7. 5mg but haven not been able to find any yet.  Shortage is supposedly ending,  so hopefully that will be resoved soon. ",Mounjaro 
"I was prescribed the 2. 5 dosage as a trial by my endocrinologist for pre diabetic and weight loss on 91522.   I felt fine the first day,  shot was given in the morning but the next day I actually forgot to eat lunch.   That is not normal for me.   I wasnt hungry.  The third and fourth day I had horrible sulphur burps,  nausea,  fatigue.  On the fourth day I took two naps which is not normal for me.   I thought my symptoms were getting worse but then the fifth and sixth day I felt great.  I am fearful to take the next injection this week as I dont want a repeat of the less than desirable side effects.  It really wrecked my weekend.   On the up side,  I lost a couple of pounds the first week.  Thats exciting but at what cost? ",Mounjaro 
I began my journey 082322.  As of 011723 I am down 55lbs.  I have had no issues.  I truly have little to no desire to eat.  I have to force myself to eat.  My blood sugar is now normal to the low end.  I really hope that insurance will kick in before the coupon is no longer effective.  I am stunned by how well this has worked.  I have tried other meds and nothing has come close.  I am 11 lbs from my goal weight.  I think I and going to have to readjust my goal.  Yay! ,Mounjaro 
"Started at the 2. 5 level and lost some weight.   15 lbs.   Sugars are down as well.   Greasy foods are not recommended.   Went to the 5. 0 level and everything dairy went bad. . . sours on the stomach badly,  and quickly.   Ate too much one night and got very ill,  vomiting and diarrhea all night along with serious gas from both ends!   I don not like  that I can not have my diary,  even tried Lactaid to no avail.   Also,  there seems to be a metallic taste in my mouth most of the time. ",Mounjaro 
I started out of the 5mg and was deathly ill from it for about a week with severe diarrhea and  belching that was so awful it made me want to vomit.   I lost 9 pounds and my sugars are going down and staying where they are supposed to be.   I called my doctor and she switched me down to the 2. 5mg better just one day of illness.   Started back on the 5mg and I still feel horrible for 24 hours after day 2 of the shot.   But sugars are awesome and I am hoping this too will pass,Mounjaro 
"Horrible experience taking this drug.  I do not recommend taking this medication unless you want to die.  I started taking 2. 5 mg 6 days ago.  Day 2 and 3 had no appetite and ate very little because the thought of food made me sick. Day 4 and 5 developed nausea,  severe abdominal pain and indigestion unrelieved by antacids. I also have lost five 1bs because I am unable to eat or drink  anything.  I do not have any energy or feel like doing anything.  Day 6 and I still feel sick.  My fasting Blood sugar this morning was 224 even though I  am not eating or drinking hardly anything at all.  It is noon and I havent eaten anything because Im afraid I will throw up.  My heart rate is 120 and normally runs in the eighties.  My doctor is out of the office this week for holidays.  Just hoping and praying I dont wind up in the emergency room.  I will never inject this toxic  stuff into my body again.  I also read that it can cause thyroid cancer. ",Mounjaro 
Im a 2 type diabetes I have been on mounjaro since 101022 I have lost 56lbs and I havent had any major side effects.  I have been eating healthy and exercising 1 hr at day so it has helped me with weight and my blood sugar. ,Mounjaro 
"I have been on Mounjaro for 9 weeks.  I had to jump from 5 to 10 mg last week due to shortage issues.  I am having several problems with severe bloating,  constipation,  headache,  and stomach pain.  I have severe gas that keeps me up most of the night and can be a sign of impending intermittent diarrhea at times.  I am always full and started pushing myself to eat as I can go all day with nothing.  Now I have small welts and itching at injection sites.  Total weight loss 0.   My blood sugar is higher especially in the morning.  This drug is horrible and I wont put my body through it anymore.  I can lose weight easier and healthier than this since it ruined my Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Years Eve.  I was so excited to try it and have hope.  Im thankful for all those who are benefiting from it.  Good luck to all.  It just wasnt for me. ",Mounjaro 
"My doctor recommended Mounjaro,  I objected because of previous experience with side effects from Byetta,  Victoza,  Trulicity.  He said the side effects were mild.  I agreed to try 2. 5,  that was a horrible decision!  My heart rate elevated,  pulse,  blood pressure increased,  couldnt eat,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  loss of sense of balance.  When to doctor 2 days later  I was so dehydrated I required 2 12 bags of IV solution to help me drive home.  I cant remember ever being so sick.  I will never take again or recommend to anyone! ",Mounjaro 
"I started using Mounjaro at 2. 4 mg,  worked great,  no side effects.  After the doctor increased it to 5 mg,  I developed severe stomach pain,  both upper and lower.  I couldn not tolerate the pain.  I was taking oxycodone.  Tried to live with the pain,  but I couldn not take it anymore,  so I stopped.  Taking this medication,  be very careful with what you are doing.  My blood pressure was very high.  My doctor was out of reach,  so I went to another doctor.  He prescribed a test on my pancreas,  and the test came out bad.  I was informed to stop this medication and take another test in six months.  They didn not tell me what is wrong they just told me to stop this medication and that I have to take another test in 6 months.  It is very serious. ",Mounjaro 
"I started at 373 pounds type 2 diabetic.  My blood sugar was under control I was taking metformin for about a year.  My A1c was around a 6.  In 2 months time I have lost 65 pounds.  I started with the 2. 5mg,  no side effects,  moved to a 5mg had the suffer burps that folks are eluding too but nothing else.  I went to the 7. 5mg then moved to the 10mg.   From about 5mg on I had to make myself eat and like others I started eating right.  My energy levels are up.  No vomiting or liver failure,  thank God.  I am now currently on the 12. 5mg.  Other than no appetite no I seemed to have dodged the side effects.  I would recommend this to anyone it has done wonders for me. ",Mounjaro 
"I started Mounjaro 7 weeks ago.  The first shot made me so nauseous and have such bad abdominal pain that lasted for 12 hours I almost went to the ER.  Told my doctor about my experience and she gave me zofran and told me to continue dieting.  Fast forward to this weekend  took my shot on Friday morning then spent all day Saturday and Sunday projectile vomiting it literally ended up about 7 feet from where I was standing,  uncontrollable diarrhea,  disgusting sulfur burps,  horrible heartburn,  and dizziness.  Finally decided to go to the ER and got treated for dehydration.  They told me to follow up with my primary doctor to talk about the best way to continue the medication.  After this experience I am NEVER taking this drug again.  While I have lose 25lbs in the past 7 weeks I believe its mostly because I have been afraid to eat anything.  I will continue to eat healthy and cut carbs and sugars but I won not be taking Mounjaro again. ",Mounjaro 
"As of today 952022,  I have been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks.   I have experienced upset stomach,  nausea,  weakness,  tiredness.   I am on 2. 5 mg.  Hoping symptoms start to disappear.  I am a Type 2 diabetic,  and the pills didn not seem to help.  I am in my 60s so was wondering if that mattered.  I am not sure.  I would like to continue the Mounjaro,  but if side effects persist,  I may have to try other options. ",Mounjaro 
"I had previously been on Trulicity,  and the doctor switched me to Mounjaro since I have so much extra weight on me.   He started me on the 5mg pen since I had already been on Trulicity.   I lost minimal weight on Trulicity.   Some,  but not enough to say it is awesome.   The only side effect I have had on Mounjaro is occasional constipationreflux,  which is manageable.  Maybe it is because I got pastthru all the nasty side effects while on Trulicity,  and that minimized the effects of Mounjaro?   I feel bad for all those that have had adverse effects on Moujarno.   I have lost about 10 pounds so far in just over 2 weeks,  and I can tell a HUGE difference in my appetite.  I mean HUGE.   I am not hungry like I used to be.   In fact,  this drug curbs my appetite SO much,  that I have to force myself eat sometimes,  and in having to do that,  it makes me instinctively want to eat more healthy food.  This drug has helped with weight loss,  and I am excited to see how much I will lose and get my A1C down. ",Mounjaro 
Been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks for weight loss.  Started with 2. 5 the first month now on 5 mg.  Lost 20 lbs so far.   Been on 5 mg for 5 days now and extremely fatigued and weak however Im not going to complain because Im not hungry at all.  Have no desire for food since being on 5 mg.   You have to make yourself eat and drink because you feel full constantly.  Mouth is very dry so drinking water regularly is a must.  Highly recommend for weight loss.  Hopefully the fatigue will go away once Im into the second week of the 5 mg and my body adjusts. ,Mounjaro 
"In November 2022,  my ACI was 7. 4 and I weighed 258 pounds at 67 years old.  The wake up call was when I renewed my life insurance,  big jump in premium due to the AC1 and weight.  I was now tagged as a Type 2 Diabetic.  I was referred to an Endocrinologist who did extensive blood work.  It was agreed to go on Mounjaro 2. 5 mg.  The first week I suffered some side effects such as nausea,   constipation,  and acid burps.  Within 10 days,  the symptoms subsided due to stool softeners,  lots of fruit berries,  and Nexium.  The first month I dropped 10 pounds with no dieting,  just was not hungry at all.  I had no cravings especially for sweets like cookies,  donuts,  and candy all things that i used to eat.  Fast forward March 2023,  I am down to 217 pounds and 20 more to go.  I am now on Mounjaro 10mg,  it a bit strong,  but the results are fantastic.  My AC1 is now 5. 6 which is fantastic.  The bad news is nothing fits,  all new suits for the spring . ",Mounjaro 
"I lost over 40 lbs and leveled off at an ideal weight.  Best of all,  my A1c dropped to a non diabetic level.  My ophthalmologist has said there is now no sign of diabetes in my eyes.  I have been able to reduce the meds I was taking.  I am much more active because I weigh so much less and feel better.  I followed the advice in the enclosure for the drug and ate small meals several times a day rather than large meals.  I have not had trouble with side effects.  I hope that the cost is reduced so that more people can afford it.  Its biggest downside is the expense. ",Mounjaro 
"I just took my fourth infection and I couldnt be more excited !  Ive lost 10 pounds in three weeks ,  my appetite is controlled ,  I feel like Ive finally got some hope to get my health where it needs to be .  My morning fasting glucose is close to 100  always near 140 no more crazy spikes hitting 200 300 .  
I do get very tired day of each shot .  The first three days or so of my first injection I was so ill  sick stomach  I got some zofran and that helped tremendously so Ill expect to need that each dose increase .  Looking very forward to 5 mg next week  ins wont pay for it yet even though Im type 2 ,  but Ive got a coupon for it and paid 25 a month .  Thank God or I couldnt get it ,  hopefully soon it will be covered . ",Mounjaro 
"I have been on Ozempic 2mg since it came out.  When I couldn not get it due to shortage I was prescribed Mounjaro 5mg.  Five days after eating my one meal a day,  I intermittent fast,  and I started vomiting.  I spent the whole night throwing up every half hour.  I  figured it was a side effect and hoped I would improve.  I had stomach and back pain,  weakness,  and was unable to eat.  I was in bed until I had to get up and sit due to pain,  sleeping off and on.  I could only drink water.  I got worse and finally,  5 days later had my husband drive me to the ER.  I know I should have gone sooner.  I didn not take a second shot. 
I had a CAT scan and was told I had a bowel obstruction and I would be admitted and there for a few days.  If they couldn not resolve through a tube down my nose I would have surgery.  Luckily it was resolved by the nasal tube,  but it was awful. 
My medical care pharmacist told me to try Mounjaro 2. 5mg.  I was worried but did it.  I didn not get nausea but I had all these other side effects.  I quit taking it. ",Mounjaro 
"Ive been taking Mounjaro now for 4 months.  I was prescribed it to treat my type 2 diabetes as well as for weight loss.  Let me just say this drug has been miracle!  I started out at 268lbs,  5ft 6in male I am now at 225lbs!  Over 40 pounds in 4 months!  Only other weight loss program that helped me like this was the military !  Now let me just say its not all Mounjaro,  Ive changed my eating habits,  and changed what foods Im actually eating and boom working like a dream.  My A1C has also dropped from 7. 5 to 5. 8,  this drug is an amazing stepping stone to a healthier life.  
Only side effects Ive experienced since starting are loss of appetite,  and constipation,  not to bad in my opinion! ",Mounjaro 
"I had a very bad experience with Mounjaro.   After two weeks of taking the 5. 0 mg,  I developed chest pains and a severe case of what I thought was reflux or heartburn.  I really felt like I might be having a heart attack.  I stopped taking it and reported it to my doctor.   My doctor suggested I should continue taking it,  but she would reduce the dose.   I went back on metformin for about a month then,  I started the 2. 5 mg dose of Mounjaro.   I took the reduced dose for about two weeks and started having severe pains in my upper stomach.   I went to urgent care,  and they examined me and took xrays,  then sent me to the ER for further tests.  After a CT scan,  I was told my gallbladder was inflamed and needed to be taken out.   I was in surgery by 1030 am the next morning to have my gallbladder removed.   I am 60 years old and have never had any problems this severe.  I have fully recovered from the surgery but now have a 1700 hospital bill.  Thank God for insurance.  The total bill was over 50, 000. ",Mounjaro 
"I am overweight and was sent to an endocrinologist by my PCP.   A1C came back 6. 9 and I received the dreaded diabetes diagnosis.  Endocrinologist asked me about my eating habits and suggested Mounjaro once a week injection.  Sceptical I was,  but I was willing to try with getting my weight down and get my A1C down.   First injection,  no severe vomiting or anything.  The only side effect I had was the constipation,  I was put on a stool softener and take fibre daily which eliminated that side effect.   Within two months I was down 15 pounds,  have not given in to eating a Boston crme doughnuts on which I tend to binge,  limited on my intake of food because over indulging makes me feel lousy and gives me indigestion,  within three months my A1C is down to 5. 3 and my weight is still going down.  Thank you so much to the researchers who created this drug because it has saved my life and gotten me on the road to better health.  The needle doesn not even hurt when I self inject.  I am grateful. ",Mounjaro 
"I was on 2. 5 dosages for several weeks.  I felt a little nauseous but was losing weight and very happy.   I was not waking up in the middle of the night feeling hungry.  When I went to refill my next prescription,  all the pharmacy had was 12. 5 mg so I agreed to try.   Huge mistake.   I have severe nausea,  felt like I have the flu,  can not stay awake,  and body aches are ridiculous,  I projectile vomited what looks like coffee grounds,  I have awful sulphuric burps,  and cant even keep down sips of water.   Ive missed 2 days of work thus far and have to have someone come to my house tomorrow to give me an iv because Im too scared to drive.   Not worth it at all. ",Mounjaro 
"I started on 2. 5mg for a month,  then went to 5mg.  All I can say is that I am tired of being sick.  It feels like a stomach bug every time you eat something,  and I am talking about healthy food.  I have had nothing but sickness.  I have not lost any weight,  I am bloated all the time and just plain sick.  It really has not done anything for me,  but I hope this helps. ",Mounjaro 
"Ive been taking Mounjaro for 5 weeksdoses.  Two days after taking the first dose,  I experienced a very stiff and sore neck.  Five weeks later,  it is just as bad and has migrated to my shoulder and arm. ",Mounjaro 
"Started this 7 weeks ago and have one more injection.  The first set was at 2. 5 mg from the gynecologist.  Within the first week,  I lost 5 pounds and by week 5 I saw a huge difference!  I went from a 22 waist to a true size 18,   and still shrinking.  I was having trouble catching my breath before I started this.   I had a couple of pains in my stomach,  similar to gas pains like clockwork,  the day after the injection.  But it was bearable.  Sometimes I get a smelly burp issue.  But now I have lost 20 pounds at week 7 and feel amazing.  Please do yourself a favor and take fiber daily,  this medicine will get you constipated. ",Mounjaro 
"I responded very well going from 0. 5 to 15 over time.  My A1C is now down to normal and my morning fasting blood sugar which is why I started this medication is also normal.  I have lost approximately 34 of original body weight over 13 months.  I did have some gastric side effects intermittently but was able to manage them with no harm.  We will taper off as this year progresses although the medication backorder may interfere with that process as we are looking to do it safely to preserve the diabetes progress Ive made thus far.  We shall see,  but it seems strange that this medication continues to be advertised while there is a shortage.  It also seems strange that in this day and age there is a shortage.  That should not be the case,  especially given the price.  Other than the disruption caused by the shortage,  I am very happy with the results and benefits of this medication.  I highly recommend it. ",Mounjaro 
I started taking this medication in December of 2022.  I have had no side effects but being a little tired.  My A1C went down significantly from 11. 7 to 5. 6 and I have lost 100 pounds.  My current dose is 12. 5 but I did start on the lowest dose and moved up.  I actually feel so much better! ,Mounjaro 
Male 70 years old.  Used Mounjaro for about 13 months.  So far  Ease of use.  A caveman could do it.   Graduated from 2. 5   15. 0 mg progressively over that time.   A1c dropped dramatically.   Weight loss 70 pounds so far.   Waist from 46 to 33 inches.   Side effects mild diarrhea occasionally.   Other   Replaced 100 of clothing.    Can see my feet without bending over.    Groceries cost dropped about 25.   A true miracle drug. ,Mounjaro 
"I started using Mounjaro 1 year ago and I lost 66 pounds so far.  I went from a size 18 to a size 12.  I am back to being a pre diabetic or not really a diabetic at all,  and I am healthier than ever because of this product.  I no longer have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.  Mounjaro saved my life. ",Mounjaro 
"In the beginning,  I didn not even feel different,  and then I stepped on the scale and was down 15 lbs after week 3.  I noticed my clothes were getting bigger and bigger,  and now I am down 80 lbs and on a 7. 5 dose.  I have had a lifelong journey with uncontrollable appetite issues,  and this medication greatly curbs them.  It did not happen overnight though,  so be patient.  If you eat a lot of cruciferous veggies,  you are going to be extremely gassy.  If you eat too much or eat things that are hard to digest,  it is going to be harder to tolerate this medication.  I have not been under 200 lbs in 20 years,  so this has been a blessing.  My blood sugars are in check,  and I have more energy.  It is at times difficult to navigate what to eat that will not upset your stomach.  Just watch what you eat and figure out what feels good to your tummy.  Your body will do better with it if you do eat some proteins every now and then instead of a lot of carbs. ",Mounjaro 
"I am taking or was taking Mounjaro and I have taken 2 months' worth of medication,  and I was feeling great.  Had to have a colonoscopy because of my age,  not the medication,  so was told to skip a week before.  I did take my last shot.  It has been 3 weeks,  and I can not get the 5ml or the 7. 5 ml.  It has been over 4 weeks I have been waiting.  I had to have my doctor make another refill,  and I am still waiting.  I have been a full blown diabetic for about a year.  I have been borderline for over 40 years.  I have high blood pressure and cholesterol problems and feel that Mounjaro was helping,  but the on again,  off again is not helping,  and I can not understand the shortage for medically needed purposes when I am over 300 lbs and 5 feet 6 inches.  I have tried numerous weight loss programs and pills,  but Mounjaro is helping me when I can get it.  The biggest benefit is the calming effect my mind has over the worry about food or sugar levels or high blood pressure.  I see a difference with Mounjaro. ",Mounjaro 
"I have been taking Mounjaro for 13 weeks.  I am currently on the 7. 5mg dose.  This medicine has changed my life!  My A1C went from 12. 9 to 6. 5 in 12 weeks.  My weight dropped 27 lbs and my relationship with food has improved 100.  
SIDE EFFECTS  slight nausea the day after I increased dosage.  Decreased appetite,  occasional need for a laxative to combat constipation. ",Mounjaro 
"If anything,  I would call Mounjaro a wonder drug.  In Jan 2023,  I weighed just over 300 pounds and my A1C was hovering around 7 with Ozempic and Metformin.  My Dr.  prescribed Mounjaro and within a few weeks,  I started seeing a marked change.  Now,  9 months later,  I have lost 108 pounds and my last A1C was 5. 0.  I have had no noticeable side effects and it couldn not be easier to use.  The only problem has been getting it.  More than once,  I have had to wait a few days for it to come back in stock at the pharmacy.  I am sleeping better,  have more energy and overall,  feeling healthier.  My Dr.  has even reduced the dosages on several of my other medications and may be able to take me off some of them soon. ",Mounjaro 
"56 year old male here,  5'10.  Started Mounjaro on 102823,  weighing 291 pounds.  Started at 2. 5mg for 4 weeks,  will be on 5. 0mg for another 5 weeks before upping to 7. 5mg.  The only real side effect has been constipation.  I just had my yearly physical yesterday.  Lost 40 pounds in 6. 5 weeks.  Blood work came back amazing.  A1C was finally under 7. 0.  Discontinuing metformin,  reducing Lipitor.  Mounjaro is life saving. ",Mounjaro 
"Started medication in early March.  One dose weekly for 6 weeks,  till I quit.  Severe nausea that would last for 5 days after each shot.  It does eliminate your desire to eat,  but I gained 11 pounds during the 6 week period.  Also,  I now have irregular heart beat and shortness of breath from this.  I have been off the medication since mid April.  It is now 6923,  and I am still having problems,  and upcoming heart tests scheduled. ",Mounjaro 
"3. 5 months from 2. 5mg to 5. 0mg.  Even before starting 7. 5mg my experience has been positive.  Less stressful as if my cortisol levels are low.  No desire to drink alcoholic beverages.  

Appetite suppressed loss of inches before any noticeable weight loss.  Slow loss of excess weight.  PCOS symptoms have mostly disappeared,  however when refills were not available,  all symptoms almost immediately presented again,  including desire to snack.  Constipation is noticeable at 5. 0mg

Starting 7. 5mg now.  22lb of excess weight lost after 3. 5mo of use. ",Mounjaro 
"My use of Mounjaro has been very positive.  My blood sugars are stable and I am down 60 pounds.  Side effects for me thus far are slight reflux if I eat too late and my taste isn not as pronounced.  But,  I feel so much better. . .  more energy and joint pain has pretty much disappeared.  Best part of all?  I am NOT HUNGRY!  I was born hungry!  Also,  for me,  the shots have been painless.  A few more pounds to go,  then I will be on a maintenance dose.  I am assuming I can take this medication long term.  Hooray for Mounjaro! ",Mounjaro 
"I started on the 2. 5 dose in October,  my doctor felt that the weight loss would help with my joint pain and lower my A1C.  From day 1 I was extremely nauseous,  had no desire to eat,  had sulfur burps,  and had constipation.  I spoke with my doctor,  who encouraged me to ride it out.  On week four I was stepped up to the 5 mg dosage.  The doctor called in Zofran for stomach issues.  On week six I called her and said I could no longer function.  During this time I was so fatigued and was having heart palpitations and was barely able to walk 20 feet without being totally exhausted.  I chalked it up to being so nauseous and not eating.  Then my legs started to burn like I had walked up a steep hill,  and felt so sore and bruised I could barely sit.  That week I had my follow up appointment with my doctor.  I told her about my symptoms,  and she said that rhabdomyolysis is not a side effect of Mounjaro.  I was never dehydrated,  but my CK levels were still 440 two weeks off the medication!  8 weeks later,  and no improvement! ",Mounjaro 
"I was put on Mounjaro 4 weeks ago for type 2 diabetes and the 3rd week the once a week injection pen didn not work.  The internal mechanics seized up and I didn not get any medicine.  I called Mounjaro support and spoke with Belinda and went through a series of questions and gave her my pharmacy information,  was on hold and also speaking with Belinda for over one hour and 15 minutes it is 3 days later and my pharmacy still did not receive a call for a replacement from Belinda.  This is a horrible product and even worse customer service. ",Mounjaro 
"Mounjaro works!  My blood sugar was off the charts.  The first week I started taking Mounjaro,  my blood sugar was within normal limits.  I dont remember the last time it was normal.  Very little side effects the first week.  No side effects second week to date.  Taking my 8th does tonight.  And lost 7 pounds. ",Mounjaro 
I started out on the 2. 5 for 2 months and lost 15 lbs and my A1C dropped from 6. 7 to 6. 0.   Mild side effect symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea.   I started the 5mg and had explosive diarrhea and uncontrollable vomiting with abdominal  back pain.  My blood pressure dropped to 8855.   I had to stop taking the Mounjaro.   After 3 weeks I am starting to feel normal again.   Sorry it didnt work for me.   It did curb the appetite. ,Mounjaro 
"My doctor put me on Mournjaro for potential type 2 diabetes.  Just after one month of taking it,  I have been through living starting into the 3rd week of taking 2. 5g. . .  for the past 2 weeks,  dizziness,  severe shaking and trembling,   my throat swelling so much that I am having trouble swallowing and having a sip of water.   I have stopped taking it,  and cannot wait for this mess to get out of my system and be normal again. .  I did not have any of these issues prior.   I did loose 12 lbs,  buts it is def not worth choking. ",Mounjaro 
"I tried to leave a review but for some reason wasn not posted,  so I will try again. 

My doctor took me off of Mounjaro recently.  I developed large welts about 24 hours after I injected the 75 doses and 10.  

My doctor fears I am developing an allergic reaction,  so I am going back to the rival insulin alternative.  I had more side effects with the Ozempic,  exhaustion,  extreme nausea,  and constipation,  but hopefully,  over time they go away this time.  Too bad,  because I really wanted to stay on Mounjaro. 

It should be noted that I really like the Mounjaro very much.  Well controlled sugar,  once I was on my maintenance dose of 10.  

For some reason,  I gained five pounds while on Mounjaro,  I never lost weight.  Where I lost about 15 pounds on the other mentioned insulin alternative.  It seems that other patients on other review sites have this welt issue too.  The issue should be reported not only to the doctor but per the request of the manufacturer,  please report to them as well. ",Mounjaro 
"I was using Ozempic but Dr switched to Mounjaro,   it has been terrible!    I lost a lot of weight on Ozempic but gained some back since being in Mounjaro also my blood sugar rose 10 15 points since switching !   I have had numerous side effects mainly headaches and constipation.   When giving it it always seems to leak back out of my skin and I have tried stomach,  arms thighs all the same!   I am not happy",Mounjaro 
"Great.  After one shot I lost a little weight and my  sugar monitor finally went under 100.  Spikes of 127 to 145 in the morning stopped.  By my third shot my glucose readings were averaging high 80s!  And lost 15 pounds.  
Still watching my diet,  no sugar, low  carbs ",Mounjaro 
"Rx for weightloss,  extreme fatigue for the first 3 days after injection I stayed in bed.  I thought it was good for controlling binge eating.  However,  I eventually started to get so dizzy after standing up that I had to hold the counters and walls to get around for the first few minutes after standing.  I also started to notice a thickness or knot in my throat after the first 2 months.  I had to stop taking because no amount of weight loss is worse than being a cancer patient or bed bound.  The weight loss was extremely slow for me too.  I went from being on no meds to relying daily on heartburn medicine,  miralax,  Tylenol  ginger chews for nausea.  And the price was ridiculous.  I would have rather bought some cosmetic surgery.  I was on it 5 months.  2. 5,  then 0. 5,  finally 7. 5mg. ",Mounjaro 
Was using it for my diabetes and the price went up on Medicare.  Mounjaro changed my life for the better.  Now cannot take it because of the cost.  PROFIT is all that matters to you.  Cost of producing it is not even close to the price you want to sell it to the public.  Give us a break! ! ,Mounjaro 
"In the past year,  I have lost 54 lbs.  My A1C is at 6. 7 from 9. 9.  My insulin use has dropped to 20 units a day.  Blood pressure has dropped as well! ! !  At this time,  I feel like Mounjaro is saving my life. ",Mounjaro 
"No side effects.  Started 12 weeks ago.  No problems.  I have been on a very strict diet for 16 weeks.  Now on the medicine Mounjaro.  I am not hungry,  so it is pretty helpful for my diet.  Hopefully,  by November,  my weight loss will be noticeable.  I have lost 16 lbs so far.  I walk and stay very active,  but I am going to increase my exercise.  I don not want to lose muscle mass and I need to keep my strength and skin healthy and tight.  I am 62 years young.  I have type two diabetes I got afterwards from Covid,  as many have.  I am hoping the Mounjaro continues to work on my A1C.  It looks like it has been so far.  I will not be staying on this drug,  I promised myself 8 months max,  so pray for me and send good karma.  Also,  my doctor finds my low calorie diet fine with the food I am eating. ",Mounjaro 
"My husband suffered from severe nausea mostly at night,  but also from loss of appetite,  constipation,  and increased fatigue.   He could not even get out of bed after one injection.   He will not take a second dose. ",Mounjaro 
"I started with 2 12 went up to five and then now I am at 10.  I lost a few pounds a week although my appetite is much less than usual.  The side effects have been very minimal mostly headache,  sore throat hoarseness seems to linger never really goes constipation.  Can be an issue at times that only for myself,  but other people I know on the same drug.   My PA is working very closely with her and paying attention to absolutely everything closely.  I feel that its a safe drug so far if you have a doctor or PA that is on board with you and to a full degree of attention. 
My hope is that once my A1c is an order that I will be able to discontinue the drug completely although some studies,  recommend that not to be probable again,  working close with my doctor and care team.  Thank you for your time. ",Mounjaro 
I like this drug!  I just can not get what strength I need to take it as prescribed.  I hate that I have to be without it for sometimes 10 days or more!  I think it should be a priority for people who need it for diabetes versus weight loss. ,Mounjaro 
"I am only on my second week,  but I have lost 7 pounds so far.  It forces me to eat because if I don not,  I feel sick,  but when I eat,  I get full super fast. . .  So it is like it is forcing me to do good and not starve myself.  I really like that.  The first week I had slight nausea here and there and a couple of headaches.  Also a little indigestion.  I do feel pretty tired.  I have been eating a low carb diet.  I am going to incorporate exercise at the end of this week.  I can only imagine how much I have the potential to lose once I start exercising,  if I have lost 7 just by eating better.  Over all I am satisfied with this drug.  I am on the low dose right now. ",Mounjaro 
"I did have many side effects to this medication at first.  However,  more recently,  I have been experiencing fewer side effects.  My A1C before taking Mounjaro was above a 10,  and now my A1C is 6. 3.  I have lost 40 lbs and have a satisfied feeling after eating a small amount of food.  My side effects at the beginning were rough nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  indigestion,  stomach pain by my liver and pancreas,  excess gasbloating,  hypoglycemia,  and sour stomach.  I know that this is a bit of a list,  however,  I feel that it is worth it in the end.  I work in a hospital and have seen the outcome of having long term effects of diabetes it is not pretty.  So,  if I have to suffer a little bit to try and prevent long term effects,  then I will.  The main effects that I have now,  after about a year or more of treatment,  are diarrhea,  sour stomach,  and some gasbloating.  I am currently on the 7. 5mg once a week and have been good on this strength for a while. ",Mounjaro 
"My dose at 2. 5mg was tolerable.  Minimal side effects.  5mg more side effects with nausea,  sour stomach,  gas.  7. 5mg has been a disaster.  Heartburn.  Headaches,  lethargy,  tiredness,  no appetite and need to force food on myself.  Low blood sugar on CGM libre2.  I can not eat enough to get myself back to 90.  I keep pegging 70 because I can not eat and am sick to my stomach all the time.  My sleep is interrupted,  and I must lie down constantly.  I feel like I want to sleep all the time.  Weight has dropped from 250 to 233 lbs,  but if I can not get out of bed,  what is the point?  I will talk to my doc about going back to 2. 5mg for the A1C control but this drug needs work. ",Mounjaro 
"The meds did exactly what I expected.  Lowered A1C and I lost weight.   
The bad part is I was so sick on days 3 5 that it was awful.  I couldnt do my usual activities.   No swimming for fear of losing control of bowels,  and severe nausea.  It worked great but the side effects were extremely uncomfortable,  lost sleep from GERD.   Disappointing for me. ",Mounjaro 
"Happy Holidays Everyone,  this medication is making it impossible for me to do anything.  Dr prescribed it   Day 1 felt fine,  Day 2 near the end of the day had no desire for food   nothing.  Today is Day 3 and Ive been nauseous all day and near the end of the day started to get diarrhea.  The nausea has been pretty bad though I did work out it made it worse and had to skip some of it.  Also,  today because of nausea,  I have not wanted anything to eat.  I forced myself to have half of an English muffin with peanut butter and then this evening a Campbell is soup to go since I was feeling so sick.  I will not be taking the second dose this coming week when it is due because I feel miserable.  It has a 5 day half life which is why I didnt want to take it to begin with in case of side effects.  It seems a lot of people get these side effects and what Ive learned is I always seem to get the side effects of medication.  Be cautious.  It needs a reversal pronto! ",Mounjaro 
"Doing very well.  No side effects.  I am 10 weeks in on the med.  My diabetes numbers are still a lot higher than I thought they would be,  but they have come down a little bit.  I have been on an extreme diet trying to only consume vegetables,  a little fruit,  and mostly fish and chicken   very low calories.  I have taken out everything white.  Almost 0 carbs to help get and keep my numbers down.  I do have yellow in the toilet I never saw before,  around the stool   yellow color in the water around the poop. ",Mounjaro 
"I have been on Mounjaro for almost 3 months.  So far,  I have had no negative side effects and I am currently on a 7. 5 mg dosage.  My blood sugars are averaging 150,  which is better than I have experienced in my more than 30 years as a type 2 diabetic.  Also,  I have lost about 12 pounds in that time,  which is fine,  but I really don not need to lose more.  I have reduced my long acting insulin to about 13 of my previous dosage.  What is amazing to me is that I can eat a meal and without fast acting insulin,  my blood sugars go down!  I guess the Mounjaro somehow senses that blood sugar is starting to rise and signals the pancreas to secrete more insulin.  So far,  I am more than happy with Mounjaro. ",Mounjaro 
"Tracked daily side effects weekly for several weeks.  Had the injection on Sunday.  The cycle was repeated each week.   If taken in the morning,  I was unable to sleep that night.  Changed to 2 hours before bed and slept but woke up feeling exhausted.  Developed headachemigraine and mind fog by mid morning with neck pain and stiffness.  Fatigue,  neck pain,  mind fog,  and migraine came in waves and lasted until late Wednesday.  I began to feel better by Thursday and back to normal by Friday.  Only small impact on blood sugar numbers.  Frequently hungry and craved carbs.  No weight loss. ",Mounjaro 
"My doctor recommended Mounjaro to me.  I was nervous about it because I wasn not sure if I could give myself a shot.  I understand all of the possible side effects.  I didn not have any side effects whatsoever.  I started taking it when I was around 288.  I am now down to 188 and I feel amazing!  When I was heavier,  I was on three different types of blood pressure medication.  I am down to just one blood pressure medication.  Not only did it help me with my A1C,  it also helped with my blood pressure and it helped me quit smoking as well! ",Mounjaro 
"I am starting week three.   As others have stated,  it changed my RELATIONSHIP with food.   I no longer focus or have cravings for salty and sweet,  carbs,  beginning day 3.  No urge for late night snacking.   I cant eat carbs like potatoes,  or bread,  or I get a stomach ache.  A big improvement  I was so fatigued before,  I could barely make it through the day and now I have the energy,  to go into the pool and do some gentle exercising.  I just dont get hungry.   I was able to drop pop completely for water.   I dont know what is in this medicine,  but it really has made a profound impact on my life.   Ive lost 6 pounds so far,  but it feels like Ive lost a couple of inches in my clothes.   Highly recommend. ",Mounjaro 
"Started August 28 with 2. 5 mg and worked up to 12. 0 mg.   Starting weight was 291. 5 and now at 252. 5 with the holidays behind me.   I haven not experienced any serious negative side effects at any dose,  but I think part of the reason has been continuing with a low carb high protein diet.   The biggest positive was reducing my appetite,  which has been a tremendous help with controlling what I eat.   I actually look forward to taking it each week! ",Mounjaro 
"A little bit of back story for the full benefit of transparencyI am a type 2 diabetic on an insulin pump taking 2 Synjardy every morning in addition to my once a week injection.  I was completely insulin resistant.  Since starting the mounjaro in September 2022 on the lowest dose,  I have worked my way up to 10mg.  Now supply shortage kept me from getting my one month supply twice in the last 7 months.  When starting again it did give me nausea and headaches,  my doctor prescribed Zofran and I took ibuprofen.  When I started I weighed 330 pounds and am currently down to 289 as of yesterday.  The biggest benefit to me is that my pump has had to work less because the mounjaro keeps my blood sugar steady at about 90.  I am hoping as I continue to lose weight I need less and less insulin,  that is the doctor is goal.  So while yes there are side effects initially they did not hang around for me and if you can push through them,  they do subside.  I am 48 years old and have been diabetic since I was 23. ",Mounjaro 
"My post wont be as exciting to everyone because I am not going to discuss the weight loss.   I will however,  boast how it has been very effective for controlling my blood sugars.   I was struggling with highs no matter what was happening and finally got control when on Ozempic.  But,  the shortage happened and my numbers started to climb again.  Now on Mounjaro and praying you keep your word and make certain that us diabetics can get it.  My numbers are looking good again.   An eye Dr visit yesterday scared me because he said I have retinal bleeds that occur when blood sugars are too high.   Diabetics need this medication and while I understand weight loss is important losing my eyesight because my blood sugars are out of control is vital.   I pray that I am able to keep on this medication because for me its my health.   For weight,  I can walk and eat better.   I am on 12. 5mg and no side effects to complain about. ",Mounjaro 
"My A1c is now 5. 1!  My hunger,  which used to be constant and persistent,  is no longer an issue.  I feel full and don not have cravings for food.  I am admittedly a 'foodie' and used food for all situations,  whether good or bad.  In addition to controlling my diabetes and improving my A1c,  Mounjaro 5mg is helping me better manage my hunger and caloric intake.  I have lost 60 pounds,  which has significantly improved my diabetes.  I have gone from morbidly obese to obese on the BMI scale,  and I feel confident that I can achieve my goal to finally reach a healthy weight with Mounjaro and my new lifestyle of healthy eating.  I haven not experienced any significant negative side effects other than some indigestion,  but I had reflux before,  so I can not say that Mounjaro is at fault solely.  The injections aren not painful and are very easy to self administer.  The once a week schedule is convenient,  so managing my type 2 diabetes is a huge success with Mounjaro so far! ",Mounjaro 
"Started Mounjaro due to negative diabetic blood  other chemistry results  did not want to use,  restart any diabetic medications due to allergic type results with them.  I am also an emotional,  indiscriminate eater.  I was 77 years old  extremely sedentary.  BP 12088,  213 pounds.  When I started in February of 2022 at beginners dose for three months when Blood Results were first taken,  A1c was at 7. 5 blood sugar,  100.  BP,  other blood results were all within acceptable limits  that time,  even though on a negative high end.  With the start of the first injection,  I noticed a fullness in my  istomach' that did not allow me try to stuff myself.  Not only did it not allow me to overeat or shove the food in my mouth,  I lost that desire.  Food did not become the first  foremost thought in my head.  What I thought about was how to manage eating.  I started seriously fasting nothing after 5 6 pm except water or unsweetened ice tea,  breaking fast around 5 6 am.  Currently on 5 mg,  A1c 6. ",Mounjaro 
I take this medication for my type 2 diabetes but after 4 months it has not helped lower my blood sugar.   I have lost 25 lbs but the cost is too high.   It causes an extremely upset stomach for four days but I feel better in time to take another shot.   I am currently on 10 mg but considering not taking it anymore. ,Mounjaro 
"Great if you can get it!  I went on Mounjaro 7. 5 eight weeks ago.  My A1C had been 9. 9 and my daily numbers in the 180s.  Trulicity was not working for me.  I am 62 and my height is 5'6'',  weight 190.  Immediately,  my numbers started coming down.  Was 90 yesterday and has not gone over 115.  You immediately get a sensation of not being full.  Have not had A1C yet but that is another four weeks away.  I have lost 8 pounds,  but that is not really my pressing concern.  I was very skinny throughout my childhood and made bad food choices later in life.  What does concern me is that all pharmacies are out of it with no word on when it is coming back in.  This is very concerning to me and Lily has gone into radio silence.  Big thing on Oprah about it last night which will now make this even harder to get.  Very,  very disappointing. ",Mounjaro 
"What a game changer this medicine is for weight loss. . . unfortunately at 500month after coupon it is just cost prohibitive.   The first month my insurance did cover,  and what I noticed were immediate impacts on appetite,  no urge to snack,  no anxiety eating,  and no hunger pangs.   I have about 60 pounds to lose,  and lost 5. 5 pounds that first month.    I did not have any side effects,  except once I ate something sweet I had a little nausea.   Lesson  don not eat sweets   I really wish my insurance would cover this,  because I have never experienced anything like it. ",Mounjaro 
"I didnt think anything could decrease my appetite,  but boy did this!   Completely lost it so much so that,  for 2 days,  my blood sugar levels were not high enough to give any injections of my regular insulin or my long acting one.  Then I started to have diarrhea.  Its not fun!   But if youre looking for something to quash your appetite,  this is it! ",Mounjaro 
"Dosage 2. 5mg.  First week had stomach problems for 2 days. 
Second week have stomach issues severe gas pains.   This is day four.  It is getting somewhat better.   Needless to say I am not going to continue on this medication.   In nine days I lost one pound woop! ",Mounjaro 
"I just finished my first month of Mounjaro 2. 5mg.   I did experience some side effects on the first day nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea but the second day was better.  After eating a small meal I experienced bad sulfur like burps throughout the day.  So I took Pepto Bismol and that worked like a charm! !  So before each one of my injections,  I take a dose of it the first half hour before with no problems now. ",Mounjaro 
"Started on 2. 5 in August because I was looking for one medication to lower A1C.  Currently on Metformin and Jardiance.  By November,  A1C dropped from 6. 9 to 5. 8.  Changing diet also helped lower cholesterol.  I titrated up to 5 mg,  but since then I have gone back to 2. 5 due to not wanting to lose any more weight.  I lost a total of 30 pounds and have been maintaining my weight for the past 30 days,  which I am comfortable with.  I worked out 3 5 days a week during this time and did intermittent fasting.  Even with working out,  I noticed muscle and strength loss,  so I am now doing more strength training to build back up.  Currently,  2. 5 mg does not suppress my appetite,  but it continues to help me with glucose levels.  I wear a CGM.  I hope to keep the weight off with the tools I have learned in the past six months.  I experienced minimal side effects on both doses,  occasionally slight headache and constipation.  My goal is to eliminate all other medications and stay on this low dose as my only medication for diabetes. ",Mounjaro 
"I am currently on 7. 5 injection and being on the medication for about 4 months,  my A1C has gone down.  I do experience a little headache and nausea after every injection but that goes away after a day.  I am really happy with this medication and I hope my A1C continues to improve as time goes by. ",Mounjaro 
"I am 72 years old and I started on Mounjaro 9 weeks ago.  I started first 4 weeks at 2. 5mg,  then next 4 weeks at 5. 0mg.   My doctor has now prescribed 7. 5 mg for the next 4 weeks.   I started on the 7. 5 mg today.   I feel very good on this medication and I have had no side effects.  My starting weight was 186 pounds.   I am 5'8 so this was more weight that I should not be carrying around.   As of this writing I weigh 177. 5 pounds.   
My beginning A1C was 9. 0,  it is down to 6. 9 and keeps very stable during the day.   I do not feel hungry or crave anything.   I feel very good and I am amazed that this medication works so well for me.   I have had diabetes for more than 10 years and this is the first time that my blood glucose readings have been so much better than ever before. ",Mounjaro 
"My a1c went from 7. 4 on insulin to 6. 1 on just Mounjaro.  I have used it for almost a year now.  Nausea the day after I take the injection is bad sometimes,  but mostly I tolerate it well.  I lost 22 lbs on it alone and went off it recently because of the cost of Medicare.  It is a great drug and has worked well for me.  I am 75 and still working full time.  I lost a total of 42 lbs but need to lose more. ",Mounjaro 
"Began taking Mounjaro at the end of May.  I weighed 179,  A1c was 7. 3.  Blood sugar in the 150s,  not good about testing.  Currently,  my weight is 137. 8   going to the endocrinologist soon.  Blood sugar fasting at 85 today.  No gastrointestinal side effects.  I do get a little itchy at the injection site around the 3rd day,  but it goes away.  My sugar cravings decreased and my appetite decreased within 3 days.  I didn not start out trying to lose weight,  but I became motivated.  I expect to be at my goal weight of 135 by my doctor is appointment and I plan to try to get to my recommended weight of 112. ",Mounjaro 
"I started on Mounjaro on Nov.  28th.  As far as side effects,  a mild headache the day of injection and the next day,  but went away the third day.  I have taken my second injection on 125 and so far,  as of 127,  no side effects.  Weight loss is 6 lbs so far,  and I am super excited to finally use a medication that doesn not give me severe stomach issues and that lowers my blood sugar.  I noticed the first week of injection my numbers going down,  and now the second week they are normal.  I haven not seen normal in about a year or close to normal.  I have been a diabetic since 2011.  Also,  I have completely changed my diet and am doing a low carb lifestyle with plenty of protein and fiber.  I still have a ways to go,  but I am very optimistic. ",Mounjaro 
"Its really helping with A1C which is in the normal range.  My side effects are vomiting and heartburn and I am losing weight.  Im now on the 12. 5 mg.  The key is to listen to your body.  It tells me when Im full and I stop eating.  That way you wont be vomiting too much.  It takes a while to figure it out.  For me,  the side effects arent worth stopping the shot. ",Mounjaro 
"I am a 66 year old female and I started on Mounjaro on November 28,  2022.  My A1C was 9,  and in 3 months,  it went down to 6.  My glucose levels reduced from 196 to 99,  triglycerides from 242 to 159,  and LDL from 203 to 165.  Additionally,  I have lost a total of 72 pounds as of July 17,  2023.  I would definitely recommend Mounjaro. ",Mounjaro 
"My A1c fell from 7. 2 to 5. 4!  I also lost 20 pounds.  Yes,  my appetite has decreased.  Yes,  I have nausea if I eat too many carbs,  but this helps me keep my numbers in check.  On the downside,  I have an increased bout of constipation which has been somewhat hard to cope with at times.  All in all,  I am very pleased with this medication and will continue using it. ",Mounjaro 
"Welts at Mounjaro  injection sites.  My doctor wants me to to stop and go back on Ozempic. 

i am taking Mounjaro 10 for Type 2 diabetes. 
It was working pretty well for last couple months until I started on the 75 dose.  Loved the low side effects and great glucose control. 

Unfortunately,  Im starting to have a reaction about 20 24 hours after I inject. 

I now have about a 6 welt every time I inject.  Feels like an awful spider bite and is a bit painful. 

Doc concerned I may have a severe reaction,  so unfortunately shes taking me off the medication. 

I did report to manufacturer.  I encourage others to do the same if you have these injection welts. 

Many others  reviews were having a similar issue.  Too bad.  LOVE the medication. ",Mounjaro 
"Helped get my sugar and weight under control right away.  Did have a lot of nausea,  diarrhea,  and burning sensation on the right side of stomach and back.  I have used all of the dosages for this medication for almost a year. ",Mounjaro 
"I just started using Mounjaro 2. 5 mg this morning.  I hope to be able to update this post as I go in order to help others know what to expect. 

The injection was a bit painful,  felt much like a bee sting.  I can not poke myself,  so one of my children pressed and held the button for me.  I looked up several videos to know how to give the injection,  which is quite easy. 

I am taking Mounjaro to lower my blood sugar.  I took it while fasting,  as I have read that is recommended.  It is been two hours and my blood sugar has dropped 60 points.  I am going to wait another hour to see if my blood sugar continues to drop.  So far,  no side effects.  I have read that the foods eaten are the reason people get nauseated and have other GI symptoms.  The best guide I have found says to eat protein lean,  fruit no skin,  and cooked vegetables.  Foods to avoid are greasy,  high fat,  and sweets. 

I will update this,  if allowed,  as I experience changes,  including side effects,  blood sugar changes,  and weight loss. ",Mounjaro 
"It is easy to use however the side effects are horrible.   I have had all of the listed side effects.  Constipation and nausea and vomiting are the worst.  It feels like a rock in my gut however,  it is a little better than ozempic which I puked every day.   so I am sticking with the Mounjaro for now. ",Mounjaro 
"I began Mounjaro to assist in my diabetic control.  I began on a very low dose,  and then went to 5 mg and then to 7. 5 mg and now 10 mg.  Since beginning the Mounjaro,  my insulin use has drastically decreased.  In fact,  since being on the 10 mg dose,  my use of long acting insulin has gone from 30 units twice daily,  down to 6 units or 0.  My fast acting insulin use was formerly up to 20 units three times a day before a meal,  and now is maybe 6 units during an entire day,  and sometimes none.  I have had a 25 pound weight loss over the last year,  and decreased appetite,  which is certainly a bonus.  I also walk 3 4 miles every morning,  so I am not certain how much weight loss is attributable to exercise,  and how much is the Mounjaro,  but I suspect a combination of both.  I have had no side effects from this medication thus far. ",Mounjaro 
"I have been on Mounjaro to help loss weight for 8 weeks,  4 at 2. 5mg  4 at 5mg and have not lost weight,  no appetite suppression at all.  I can not tell I am taking anything at all other than burping,  acid reflux and stomach pain through the night after eating. ",Mounjaro 
"I was prescribed this medication after having an ESG procedure to help with weight loss and in hopes to reverse Type 2.   I also have PCOS and a family history of Type 2.   After being on this medication I am down at least 10 lbs dont remember my weight when I started and my blood glucose is not in diabetic range.   My A1C was 5. 9,  down from 7. 9 and I expect that to be lower on my next labs.   I do have some side effects the most prominent is constipation.   Miralax helps.   I used to get a headache after injection but I take ibuprofen before hand and that helps.   I also inject my thigh,  not my stomach and I do it before bed.   I have to remember to eat and drink water.   I would recommend this medication.   I hope Ive lost enough weight to get off and stay off.   So far so good. ",Mounjaro
